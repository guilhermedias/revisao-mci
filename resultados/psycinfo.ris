N2  - Interventions for age-associated cognitive impairment are of increasing significance as populations age. Using N-back and memory strategy enhancement, the present study aimed to explore the feasibility of using, and outcomes of a working memory (WM) training program on visuospatial and verbal WM in older female adults. Older women from two comparable local health centers who scored 26 and higher on Mini-Mental State Examination were invited to participate. Women at one center (experimental group) received three sessions on memory enhancement techniques and a computerized training program with N-back. Women at the other center (control group) received three sessions on memory and aging and training on using various features of cellphones. All participants completed the Corsi Block Task and Digit Span Task at pre- and post-training. The experimental group showed significant improvements in their visuospatial and verbal WM compared to the control group. These findings support the brain’s plasticity in the elderly. WM training for improving cognitive performance in older adults has potential and should be further investigated. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objectives: To explore the transfer effects of cognitive training on working memory among older Chinese adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: Sixty-two MCI participants aged more than 60 years old were recruited by holding recruitment sessions in communities in China [33 for cognitive training, and 29 for mental leisure activities (MLA) control]. Cognitive functions, including working memory, execution function, reasoning ability, verbal ability, ability of daily living, were measured at three time-points (baseline, post-training and 3 months after training). Results: Compared to the MLA control, the cognitive training group showed significant effects in both the trained (working memory) and untrained (execution function and ability of daily living) domains. The effects of cognitive training on overall cognitive function, working memory and daily life ability of daily living of MCI could be maintained for at least 3 months, even without the cognitive training. Besides, complete mediating effects of cognitive training were found in executive function through working memory and working memory in ability of daily living though executive function, which suggests the presence of transfer effect of cognitive training. Conclusions: The present study supported that cognitive training could effectively improve working memory in elders with MCI. The training effects on working memory could transfer to other untrained areas (such as executive function), which also improved the comprehensive ability (ability of daily living). And the effects of training could largely persist for 3 months. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objectives: To report experience with a large, nation‐wide public memory screening program. Design: Descriptive study of community‐dwelling elderly adults. Setting: Local community sites (48 sites agreed to provide data) throughout the United States participating in National Memory Screening Day in November 2010. Participants: Of 4,369 reported participants, 3,064 had complete data records and are included in this report. Measurements: Participants completed a questionnaire that included basic demographic information and a question about subjective memory concerns. Each site selected one of seven validated cognitive screening tests: Mini‐Cog, General Practitioner assessment of Cognition, Memory Impairment Screen, Kokmen Short Test of Mental Status, Mini‐Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Saint Louis University Mental Status Examination. Results: Overall, 11.7% failed one of the seven screening tests. As expected, failure rates were higher in older and less‐educated participants (P's < .05). Subjective memory concerns were associated with a 40% greater failure rate for persons of similar age and education but no memory concerns (odds ratio = 1.4, 95% confidence interval = 1.07–1.78), although only 11.9% of those who reported memory concerns (75% of all participants) had detectible memory problems. Conclusion: Screening for cognitive impairment in community settings yielded results consistent with expected effects of age and education. The event attracted a large proportion of individuals with memory concerns; 88.1% were told that they did not have memory problems detectible with the tests used. Further studies are needed to assess how participants respond to and use screening information, whether this information ultimately influences decision‐making or outcomes, and whether memory screening programs outside healthcare settings have public health value.

N2  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 119(Part A) of Brain Research Bulletin (see record 2015-55979-011). The authors regret an error involving the order of authorship that was missed during the final submission process of manuscript. The first author should be Hilda Martinez-Coria, followed by Stephen T. Yeung. The updated author list is present in the erratum.] Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease associated with progressive memory and cognitive decline. Previous studies have identified the benefits of cognitive enrichment on reducing disease pathology. Additionally, epidemiological and clinical data suggest that repeated exercise, and cognitive and social enrichment, can improve and/or delay the cognitive deficiencies associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study, 3xTg-AD mice were exposed to a rigorous training routine beginning at 3 months of age, which consisted of repeated training in the Morris water maze spatial recognition task every 3 months, ending at 18 months of age. At the conclusion of the final Morris water maze training session, animals subsequently underwent testing in another hippocampus-dependent spatial task, the Barnes maze task, and on the more cortical-dependent novel object recognition memory task. Our data show that periodic cognitive enrichment throughout aging, via multiple learning episodes in the Morris water maze task, can improve the memory performance of aged 3xTg-AD mice in a separate spatial recognition task, and in a preference memory task, when compared to naïve aged matched 3xTg-AD mice. Furthermore, we observed that the cognitive enrichment properties of Morris water maze exposer, was detectable in repeatedly trained animals as early as 6 months of age. These findings suggest early repeated cognitive enrichment can mitigate the diverse cognitive deficits observed in Alzheimer’s disease. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Mismatch negativity (MMN) is suitable for studies of preattentive auditory discriminability and the auditory memory trace. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is an ideal target for early therapeutic intervention because SCD occurs at preclinical stages many years before the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). According to a novel lifespan-based model of dementia risk, hearing loss is considered the greatest potentially modifiable risk factor of dementia among nine health and lifestyle factors, and hearing impairment is associated with cognitive decline. Therefore, we propose a neurofeedback training based on MMN, which is an objective index of auditory discriminability, to regulate sensory ability and memory as a non-pharmacological intervention (NPI) in SCD patients. Seventeen subjects meeting the standardized clinical evaluations for SCD received neurofeedback training. The auditory frequency discrimination test, the visual digital N-back (1-, 2-, and 3-back), auditory digital N-back (1-, 2-, and 3-back), and auditory tone N-back (1-, 2-, and 3-back) tasks were used pre- and post-training in all SCD patients. The intervention schedule comprised five 60-min training sessions over 2 weeks. The results indicate that the subjects who received neurofeedback training had successfully improved the amplitude of MMN at the parietal electrode (Pz). A slight decrease in the threshold of auditory frequency discrimination was observed after neurofeedback training. Notably, after neurofeedback training, the working memory (WM) performance was significantly enhanced in the auditory tone 3-back test. Moreover, improvements in the accuracy of all WM tests relative to the baseline were observed, although the changes were not significant. To the best of our knowledge, our preliminary study is the first to investigate the effects of MMN neurofeedback training on WM in SCD patients, and our results suggest that MMN neurofeedback may represent an effective treatment for intervention in SCD patients and the elderly with aging memory decline.

N2  - Background: Deficits in executive functioning are of great significance in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). One of these executive functions, working memory, plays an important role in academic performance and is often seen as the core deficit of this disorder. There are indications that working memory problems and academic performance can be improved by school-oriented interventions but this has not yet been studied systematically. In this study we will determine the short- and long-term effects of a working memory—and an executive function training applied in a school situation for children with AD(H)D, taking individual characteristics, the level of impairment and costs (stepped-care approach) into account. Methods/design: The study consists of two parts: the first part is a randomised controlled trial with school-aged children (8–12 yrs) with AD(H)D. Two groups (each n = 50) will be randomly assigned to a well studied computerized working memory training ‘Cogmed’, or to the ‘Paying attention in class’ intervention which is an experimental school-based executive function training. Children will be selected from regular -and special education primary schools in the region of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The second part of the study will determine which specific characteristics are related to non-response of the ‘Paying attention in class’ intervention. School-aged children (8–12 yrs) with AD(H)D will follow the experimental school-based executive function training ‘Paying attention in class’ (n = 175). Academic performance and neurocognitive functioning (primary outcomes) are assessed before, directly after and 6 months after training. Secondary outcome measures are: behaviour in class, behaviour problems and quality of life. Discussion: So far, there is limited but promising evidence that working memory—and other executive function interventions can improve academic performance. Little is know about the applicability and generalization effects of these interventions in a classroom situation. This study will contribute to this lack of information, especially information related to real classroom and academic situations. By taking into account the costs of both interventions, level of impairment and individual characteristics of the child (stepped-care approach) we will be able to address treatment more adequately for each individual in the future.

N2  - Goal Management Training (GMT) is an effective method for improving disorganised behaviour in multistep real-life tasks after brain damage. In the present study we incorporated Working Memory Training (WMT) in GMT to explore their combined efficacy in facilitating the serial-order maintenance of the steps that had to be learned. GMT+WMT was compared to a control WMT designed for other purposes. For this purpose 18 brain-injured patients (aged 20–54), who were at least 4 months post-onset, were randomly assigned to either the GMT+WMT or the WMT treatment. Inclusion was based on a baseline score of less than six correct steps on each of two multistep everyday tasks. Alternative versions of these tasks were used as primary outcome tasks. Pre-treatment and post-treatment comparisons of scores on these primary tasks and on several secondary neuropsychological measures were collected. The results show that post-treatment the GMT+WMT group performed significantly better than the WMT group on the primary outcome measures and on several ecologically valid executive tests that demanded a step-by-step maintenance of multiple actions. Time effects were found for both groups on the secondary measures. Other measures showed no significant differences. We conclude that our results support the efficacy of the combined GMT+WMT in facilitating performance in everyday multistep tasks. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: It has been suggested that physical inactivity and lack of stimulating cognitive activity are the two most significant modifiable risk factors to impair cognitive function. Although many studies that investigated the cognitive effects of physical exercise and cognitive stimuli in dual-task conditions showed improved cognitive performance, others have not confirmed these findings. The main aim of the present work is to analyze the effects of a dual-task multimodal physical exercise training, at moderate intensity, and cognitive stimulation on cognitive and physical function in healthy older adults. Methods: This clinical trial was registered on the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (RBR-9zrx3d). Here we tested the effects of a dual-task multimodal physical exercise training, at moderate intensity, on cognitive and physical function and quality of life in community dwelling older adults. The training protocol included 24 group sessions, 2/week, per 75 min. Cognition was assessed using CANTAB automated neuropsychological tests and Functional Capacity to Exercise tests. Performance was compared from baseline to post intervention and to a non-exercise control group using Mixed Linear Model for repeated measures. Results: Control (CG) and dual-task (DTEx) groups progressed differentially over time on performance of episodic memory, sustained visual attention, functional mobility, cardiorespiratory fitness, lower limbs strength resistance, agility, quality of life and dualtask performance with significant improved DTEx performance. Control group did not show any significant changes on these tests except for showing a reduction in dual-task performance. Conclusion: We suggest that the dual-task combination of multisensory cognitive stimulation and multimodal moderate physical exercise training, twice a week, may be adopted as an effective program to reduce progression of age-related cognitive decline and improve physical fitness and quality of life on healthy older adults.

N2  - Objective: To determine the effectiveness of a program of cognitive stimulation of the elderly residents in Social Protection Centers in Cartagena, 2014. Methods: Quasi-experimental study with pre and post tests in control and experimental groups. A sample of 37 elderly residents in Social Protection Centers participated: 23 in the experimental group and 14 in the control group. A survey and a mental evaluation test (Pfeiffer) were applied. The experimental group participated in 10 sessions of cognitive stimulation. Results: The paired t-test showed statistically significant differences in the Pfeiffer test, pre and post intervention, compared to the experimental group (P = .0005). The unpaired t-test showed statistically significant differences in Pfeiffer test results to the experimental and control groups (P = .0450). The analysis of the main components showed that more interrelated variables were: age, diseases, number of errors and test results; which were grouped around the disease variable, with a negative association. Conclusions: The intervention demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in cognitive functionality of the elderly. Nursing can lead this type of intervention. It should be studied further to strengthen and clarify these results. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objectives: To investigate maintenance of training effects of a novel brain plasticity–based computerized cognitive training program in older adults after a 3‐month no‐contact period. Design: Multisite, randomized, controlled, double‐blind trial with two treatment groups. Setting: Communities in northern and southern California and Minnesota. Participants: Four hundred eighty‐seven community‐dwelling adults aged 65 and older without diagnosis of clinically significant cognitive impairment. Intervention: Random assignment into a broadly available brain plasticity–based computerized cognitive training program experimental group or a novelty‐ and intensity‐matched cognitive stimulation active control. Assessments at baseline, after training, and at 3 months. Measurements: The primary outcome was a composite of auditory subtests of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. Secondary measures included trained task performance, standardized neuropsychological assessments of overall memory and attention, and participant‐reported outcomes (PROs). Results: A significant difference in improvement from baseline to 3‐month follow‐up was seen between the experimental training and control groups on the secondary composite of overall memory and attention, (P=.01, d=0.25), the trained processing‐speed measure (P d=0.80), word list total recall (P=.004, d=0.28), letter–number sequencing (P=.003, d=0.29), and the cognitive subscale of PRO (P=.006, d=0.27). Previously significant improvements became nonsignificant at the 3‐month follow‐up for the primary outcome, two secondary measures of attention and memory, and several PROs. Narrative memory continued to show no advantage for the experimental group. Effect sizes from baseline to follow‐up were generally smaller than effect sizes from baseline to posttraining. Conclusion: Training effects were maintained but waned over the 3‐month no‐contact period. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Aims: Cognitive impairment causes functional impairment and declining quality of life in the elderly. Occupational therapy (OT) could help to prevent or slow cognitive decline. However, little is known of how OT parameters could influence cognitive impairment. Methods: We conducted an observational study over the course of 1 year, on 94 long-term care residents, analyzing cognitive impairment. The cohort was split into three groups, each being provided with different amounts of OT (non-OT, 2 h OT a week, and 10 h OT a week). The OT program consisted of cognitive and memory training, reality orientation, psychomotor activities, and crafts. Results: Our results show that OT is effective in slowing cognitive decline and its effectiveness seems to be proportional to the hours of OT received. The 10 h OT group showed significantly reduced Mini-Mental State Examination score compared with the non-OT group (p < 0.01). OT also appears to be useful in people with previous cognitive impairment. Conclusions: The study adds to the growing literature of OT interventions for older adults and our findings support the concept that OT could be effective in slowing cognitive impairment in the elderly.

N2  - Strategies based memory training programs are widely used to enhance the cognitive abilities of the elderly. Participants in these training programs are usually people whose mental abilities remain intact. Occasionally, people with cognitive impairment also participate. The aim of this study was to test if memory training designed specifically for healthy people is effective in people with severe memory impairment. We carried out a 10-year retrospective case-control study with Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT) and memory complaint measures obtained pre-post training. The case group consisted of 73 people with memory impairment (IM group). The control group (n = 72) was made of individuals with preserved memory and sociodemographic characteristics similar to the case group (PM group). Both groups improved their performance on everyday memory tasks (measured using the RBMT). The IM group improved more than the PM group in everyday memory tasks, especially in prospective memory tasks. Both groups also reduced their level of subjective complaints as a result of training. In conclusion, our results are encouraging with respect to the efficacy of comprehensive memory training programs for older people with severe memory impairment.

N2  - The surrounding circumstances and environments of Malaysian older adults could make conducting interventions (mainly in terms of clinical or randomized controlled trials) a challenge. Working with older adults and facing cultural issues could be challenging. Objective: This paper illustrates a significant perspective of some of the challenges faced while conducting a randomized controlled trial exploring the impact of a multi-component intervention that included strategy- and process-based prospective memory (PM) training among Malaysian older adults. Methods: The current study was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and therefore the challenges were presented in accordance with the CONSORT statement style. Results: A discussion on how these issues were addressed is provided. Conclusion: Some suggestions were presented to help researchers plan and create interventions for similar studies and to support a practical method of addressing all related challenges.

In the original article, on page 795, Berna Abedelsater is given as one ofthe authors. However, this name should be changed to Berna Rahi.] Background: Several modifiable lifestyle factors have been shown to have potential beneficial effects in slowing cognitive decline. Two such factors that may affect cognitive performance and slow the progression of memory loss into dementia in older adults are cognitive training and physical activity. There are currently no effective treatments for dementia; therefore, preventative strategies to delay or prevent the onset of dementia are of critical importance. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the relative effectiveness of simultaneous performance of memory training and aerobic exercise to a sequential performance intervention on memory functioning in older adults. Methods: 55 older adults (aged 60-75) with subjective memory impairments (non-demented and non-MCI) completed the intervention that consisted of 90-minute small group classes held twice weekly. Participants were randomized to either 4-weeks of supervised strategy-based memory training done simultaneously while stationary cycling (SIM) or sequentially after the stationary cycling (SEQ). Standardized neurocognitive measures of memory, executive functioning, speed of processing, attention, and cognitive flexibility were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Results: The SIM group, but not the SEQ group, had a significant improvement on composite memory following the intervention (t(51) = 2.7,p = 0.01, effect size (ES) = 0.42) and transfer to non-trained reasoning abilities (t(51) = 6.0, ES = 0.49) and complex attention (t(51) = 3.1, p = 0.003, ES = 0.70). Conversely, the SEQ group, but not the SIM, showed significant improvement in executive functioning (t(51) = 5.0, p = 0.0001, ES = 0.96). Conclusion: These findings indicate that a 4-week simultaneous memory training and aerobic exercise program is sufficient to improve memory, attention, and reasoning abilities in older adults.

N2  - Background: In humans, retrospective studies suggest that habitual physical activity (PA) or cognitive activity (CA) can help maintain or improve cognitive function. Similar findings have been reported using physical exercise in animal studies; however, the exercise paradigms differ markedly in duration and frequency, making extrapolation difficult. Here, the authors present a novel PA and CA paradigm that combines voluntary wheel running with Hebb-Williams and radial arm maze (RAM) training. Methods: A total of 57 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 treatment groups: the PA, CA, and combined PA and CA groups and sedentary controls. PA (voluntary wheel running) and CA (Hebb-Williams mazes) consisted of a moderate 2 h/d, 5 d/wk treatment paradigm. Results: Animals exposed to a combination of PA and CA made significantly fewer working memory errors and exhibited superior choice accuracy when compared with animals exposed to either PA or CA alone in the 8-arm baited configuration of the RAM. Additional analyses revealed that the cognitive improvements were independent of exercise intensity/duration. Assessment of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels revealed a significant increase in hippocampal BDNF only in the PA-alone group. Conclusion: A novel combination of PA and CA improves learning and memory abilities independent of activity intensity, BDNF, or phosphorylated cyclic AMP response element binding protein levels. This is the first report of significant changes in cognitive ability using a paradigm involving moderate levels of PA plus cognitive stimulation. An adaptation of this paradigm may be particularly beneficial in slowing the development of mild cognitive impairment and subsequent dementia in elderly people.

N2  - The affirmative position is argued in response to the question of whether intervention in the disease course of Alzheimer disease (AD) occurs too late. AD is not a singular, homogeneous disease, but rather a final common pathway or end-point that can be arrived at through multiple routes. As part of the affirmative argument, there is a delineation of two long-term trajectories leading to AD: (1) normal elderly progression to AD, and (2) depressed elderly progression to AD. In documenting normal elderly devolution into AD, two “normal” elderly pre-AD or prodromal stages are discussed: age-associated memory impairment (AAMI) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Data are provided evidencing significantly high conversion rates from these pre-AD stages to actual AD. Using the same paradigmatic approach that is used in documenting normal elderly decline into AAMI and MCI with eventual conversion to AD; there is explication of depressed elderly conversion to AD. The long-term, multiphasic disease progression of major depression without dementia to depressive dementia to final conversion to AD is brought into focus as another example of why intervention must occur prior to actual conversion to AD. Depression is defined as a cognitive syndrome and risk factor for AD requiring aggressive targeted intervention. AD does not just come suddenly out of nowhere. First intervention must occur during the pre-AD phases in an attempt to prevent, delay, and interrupt long-term neurodegenerative processes involved in both normal elderly and depressed elderly conversion to AD. A primary strategy proposed is to delay onset of AD. Population statistics indicate that if AD is delayed by a modest 1 year, there would be 9.5 million fewer cases by 2050, resulting in significant reduction in burden of disease. Data show early intervention with cognitive stimulation (mental exercise), physical exercise, aggressive treatment of AD risk factors and excess disability, psychotherapy, and other nonpharmacological interventions in combination with each other and/or with medications can result in delay of onset of AD. First intervention at time of diagnosis of AD is too late, when by definition, final conversion to AD has already occurred. When we have knowledge to successfully intervene earlier, why would we not want to do so. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Cognitive flexibility has repeatedly been shown to improve after training programs in community‐dwelling older adults, but few studies have focused on healthy older adults living in other settings. Objectives: This study investigated the efficacy of self‐help training for healthy older adults in a residential care center on memory tasks they practiced (associative and object list learning tasks) and any transfer to other tasks (grocery lists, face–name learning, figure–word pairing, word lists, and text learning). Transfer effects on everyday life (using a problem‐solving task) and on participants' beliefs regarding their memory (efficacy and control) were also examined. With the aid of a manual, the training adopted a learner‐oriented approach that directly encouraged learners to generalize strategic behavior to new tasks. The maintenance of any training benefits was assessed after 6 months. Method: The study involved 34 residential care center residents (aged 70–99 years old) with no cognitive impairments who were randomly assigned to two programs: the experimental group followed the self‐help training program, whereas the active control group was involved in general cognitive stimulation activities. Results: Training benefits emerged in the trained group for the tasks that were practiced. Transfer effects were found in memory and everyday problem‐solving tasks and on memory beliefs. The effects of training were generally maintained in both practiced and unpracticed memory tasks. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that learner‐oriented self‐help training enhances memory performance and memory beliefs, in the short term at least, even in residential care center residents.

N2  - According to the WHO, by 2025 Brazil will be ranked sixth in the world in terms of proportion of elderly in the population. Within this scope, cognition plays a central role in the aging process, having an important association with quality of life, which suggests the need to develop intervention programs, such as cognitive training. Objective: To determine the effects of a program of cognitive stimulation workshops on the self-esteem and cognition of elderly people. Methods: Thirty-eight elderly subjects completed the three-step protocol: 1) Survey of demographic data and evaluation of cognition by a neuropsychological battery and of self-esteem using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSS), prior to training; 2) Participation in twelve cognitive stimulation workshops; and 3) Cognitive evaluation and RSS after the training. Results: Results showed that the use of training produced positive effects on cognitive test performance of the elderly with and without cognitive impairment. By extension, this demonstrates positive impact on their self-esteem. Conclusion: These findings encourage investment in cognitive stimulation programs as a resource for improved cognition and quality of life for the elderly. Subjective cognitive complaint may have served as a predictor of decreased self-esteem; therefore, as training improved cognition, it also improved self-esteem.

N2  - Objective: The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness of caregiver-provided individual cognitive interventions for improving cognition, social functioning and quality of life in older adults with major neurocognitive disorders.Introduction:A large number of people with major neurocognitive disorders live in their homes, requiring ongoing community care. Different individual cognitive intervention programs have been explored as a potential approach for implementation by caregivers on a one-to-one basis. These programs have the advantage of being implemented in a home setting and in the real-life context of the older adult, in a society that is increasingly aging and where aging in place is being fostered. Inclusion criteria:This review considered experimental studies that included older adults aged 60 years and over with major neurocognitive disorders who were receiving individual cognitive interventions (e.g. cognitive stimulation, cognitive training or cognitive rehabilitation) provided by their caregivers. The comparator was usual care, wait-list control or alternative therapeutic intervention. The primary outcomes of interest included cognition, social functioning and quality of life. Additionally, behavior, mood and activities of daily living were considered. Methods: A comprehensive search strategy was used to identify relevant published and unpublished studies from January 1995 to March 2018, written in English, Spanish and Portuguese. Studies meeting the inclusion criteria were retrieved and their methodological quality was assessed by two independent reviewers using the JBI critical appraisal checklists for randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies. Quantitative data were extracted using the standardized data extraction tool from the JBI System for the Unified Management, Assessment and Review of Information. Due to the clinical and methodological heterogeneity in the included studies, statistical pooling was not possible. Therefore, findings are presented in a narrative format. Results: Eight randomized controlled trials and two quasi-experimental studies were included, with a total sample of 844 dyads (older adults and caregivers). The number of dyads included in the studies ranged from 16 to 356. Beneficial effects of the caregiver-provided individual cognitive interventions were observed in various cognitive domains, including memory, attention, verbal fluency and problem-solving. Two studies additionally reported the positive impact of the intervention of interest on general cognitive functioning. None of the reviewed studies revealed significant changes in quality of life. Social functioning was not analyzed in any of the included studies. Beneficial effects were also reported in relation to behavior and activities of daily living, despite the low level of evidence. Conclusions: This review responds to a gap in current international literature on the synthesis of evidence on the use of caregiver-provided individual cognitive interventions. The intervention of interest is associated with improvement in cognitive performance, revealing some benefits for the stabilization of neuropsychiatric symptoms and an increase in autonomy in activities of daily living. Further research on the impact of sociodemographic and clinical factors on the intervention effects is needed, as these factors seem to interfere with successful intervention implementation. To reinforce current evidence, the methodological quality of future studies should be improved. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread worldwide and has had unprecedented effects in healthcare systems, economies and society. COVID-19 clinical presentation primarily affects the respiratory system causing bilateral pneumonia, but it is increasingly being recognized as a systemic disease, with neurologic manifestations reported in patients with mild symptoms but, most frequently, in those in a severe condition. Elderly individuals are at high risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19 due to factors associated with aging and a higher prevalence of medical comorbidities and, therefore, they are more vulnerable to possible lasting neuropsychiatric and cognitive impairments. Several reports have described insomnia, depressed mood, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and cognitive impairment in a proportion of patients after discharge from the hospital. The potential mechanisms underlying these symptoms are not fully understood but are probably multifactorial, involving direct neurotrophic effect of SARS-CoV-2, consequences of long intensive care unit stays, the use of mechanical ventilation and sedative drugs, brain hypoxia, systemic inflammation, secondary effects of medications used to treat COVID-19 and dysfunction of peripheral organs. Chronic diseases such as dementia are a particular concern not only because they are associated with higher rates of hospitalization and mortality but also because COVID-19 further exacerbates the vulnerability of those with cognitive impairment. In patients with dementia, COVID-19 frequently has an atypical presentation with mental status changes complicating the early identification of cases. COVID-19 has had a dramatical impact in long-term care facilities, where rates of infection and mortality have been very high. Community measures implemented to slow the spread of the virus have forced to social distancing and cancelation of cognitive stimulation programs, which may have contributed to generate loneliness, behavioral symptoms and worsening of cognition in patients with dementia. COVID-19 has impacted the functioning of Memory Clinics, research programs and clinical trials in the Alzheimer’s field, triggering the implementation of telemedicine. COVID-19 survivors should be periodically evaluated with comprehensive cognitive and neuropsychiatric assessments, and specific mental health and cognitive rehabilitation programs should be provided for those suffering long-term cognitive and psychiatric sequelae.

N2  - The growing elderly population and the increased incidence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) call for the improvement of the quality and the efficacy of the healthcare and social support services. Exercise and cognitive stimulation have been demonstrated to mitigate cognitive impairment and oxidative stress (OxS) has been recognized as a factor that contributes to the advancement of neurodegenerative diseases. Taking these aspects into account, the impact of a novel virtual reality (VR)-based program combining aerobic exercise and cognitive training has been evaluated in the pilot study proposed here. Ten patients (aged 73.3 ± 5.7 years) with MCI (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE: 23.0 ± 3.4) were randomly assigned to either 6 weeks physical and cognitive training (EXP) or control (CTR) group. Evaluations of cognitive profile, by a neuropsychological tests battery, and OxS, by collection of blood and urine samples, were performed before and at the end of the experimental period. The assessment of the patients’ opinions toward the intervention was investigated through questionnaires. EXP group showed a tendency towards improvements in the MMSE, in visual-constructive test and visuo-spatial tests of attention, while CTR worsened. EXP group showed a greater improvement than CTR in the executive test, memory functions and verbal fluency. No statistical significance was obtained when comparing within and between both the groups, probably due to small number of subjects examined, which amplifies the effect of the slight heterogeneity in scores recorded. Despite a greater worsening of Daily Living Activities tests, all participants reported a better performance in real life, thanks to the elicited self-perceived improvement. After training intervention OxS (i.e., reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, oxidative damage of lipids and DNA) decreased resulting in significantly (range p < 0.05–0.001) lower in EXP vs. CTR group. Although not conclusive, the recorded effects in the present study are promising and suggest that this proposal would be a useful tool in support of cognitive training reducing OxS too. However, further studies on larger scale samples of patients are needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Cognitive decline is a symptom of healthy ageing and Alzheimer’s disease. We examined the effect of real-time fMRI based neurofeedback training on visuo-spatial memory and its associated neuronal response. Twelve healthy subjects and nine patients of prodromal Alzheimer’s disease were included. The examination spanned five days (T1–T5): T1 contained a neuropsychological pre-test, the encoding of an itinerary and a fMRI-based task related that itinerary. T2–T4 hosted the real-time fMRI neurofeedback training of the parahippocampal gyrus and on T5 a post-test session including encoding of another itinerary and a subsequent fMRI-based task were done. Scores from neuropsychological tests, brain activation and task performance during the fMRI-paradigm were compared between pre and post-test as well as between healthy controls and patients. Behavioural performance in the fMRI-task remained unchanged, while cognitive testing showed improvements in visuo-spatial memory performance. Both groups displayed task-relevant brain activation, which decreased in the right precentral gyrus and left occipital lobe from pre to post-test in controls, but increased in the right occipital lobe, middle frontal gyrus and left frontal lobe in the patient group. While results suggest that the training has affected brain activation differently between controls and patients, there are no pointers towards a behavioural manifestation of these changes. Future research is required on the effects that can be induced using real-time fMRI based neurofeedback training and the required training duration to elicit broad and lasting effects.

N2  - Background: Research on predictors of working memory training responsiveness, which could help tailor cognitive interventions individually, is a timely topic in healthy aging. However, the findings are highly heterogeneous, reporting partly conflicting results following a broad spectrum of methodological approaches to answer the question “who benefits most” from working memory training. Objective: The present systematic review aimed to systematically investigate prognostic factors and models for working memory training responsiveness in healthy older adults. Method: Four online databases were searched up to October 2019 (MEDLINE Ovid, Web of Science, CENTRAL, and PsycINFO). The inclusion criteria for full texts were publication in a peer-reviewed journal in English/German, inclusion of healthy older individuals aged ≥ 55 years without any neurological and/or psychiatric diseases including cognitive impairment, and the investigation of prognostic factors and/or models for training responsiveness after targeted working memory training in terms of direct training effects, near-transfer effects to verbal and visuospatial working memory as well as far-transfer effects to other cognitive domains and behavioral variables. The study design was not limited to randomized controlled trials. Results: A total of 16 studies including n = 675 healthy older individuals with a mean age of 63.0–86.8 years were included in this review. Within these studies, five prognostic model approaches and 18 factor finding approaches were reported. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognosis Studies checklist, indicating that important information, especially regarding the domains study attrition, study confounding, and statistical analysis and reporting, was lacking throughout many of the investigated studies. Age, education, intelligence, and baseline performance in working memory or other cognitive domains were frequently investigated predictors across studies. Conclusions: Given the methodological shortcomings of the included studies, no clear conclusions can be drawn, and emerging patterns of prognostic effects will have to survive sound methodological replication in future attempts to promote precision medicine approaches in the context of working memory training. Methodological considerations are discussed, and our findings are embedded to the cognitive aging literature, considering, for example, the cognitive reserve framework and the compensation vs. magnification account. The need for personalized cognitive prevention and intervention methods to counteract cognitive decline in the aging population is high and the potential enormous.

N2  - Episodic memory problems are the hallmark of cognitive ageing in normal elderly people. Learning of new material is worse in pathological cognitive ageing, such as dementia and its preliminary states (mild cognitive impairment). Because episodic learning is crucial to preserve independent living in the elderly, rehabilitation programmes for everyday memory problems are welcomed. The scope of scientific interest has switched from treatment to prevention. We claim that lifestyle interventions are the most direct way to preserve cognition. We summarize evidence for changes in nutrition and exercise. In addition, psychological interventions for elderly people with normal or pathological cognitive ageing are available. Recent meta-analyses found lacking evidence of transfer to everyday life and long-term effects. We critically assess these meta-analyses. We propose theoretically derived experimental interventions relying on spared learning mechanisms. As an example we report visual-imagery training showing positive effects in a randomized control trial, using individual memory diaries on memory improvement.

N2  - Subjective cognitive and memory complaints (SMC) are common in later life and are considered an indicator for progression to cognitive decline. The aim of the present study was to identify the relationship among SMC, neuropsychiatric symptoms and psychological aspects in elderly subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as well as to analyse the effect on SMC of a comprehensive cognitive training. Data from a sample of 94 patients enrolled in ‘My Mind Project’ (Grant No. 154/GR-2009-1584108) were collected. The study evidenced that depression was a significant predictor of SMC and that after the training, the number of subjects with SMC was significantly reduced in the experimental group in comparison to the control one. These results suggest that the participation in cognitive stimulation protocols may improve the perception of SMC in subjects with MCI. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Associative object-location memory (OLM) is known to decline even in normal aging, and this process is accelerated in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Given the lack of curative treatment for Alzheimer's disease, activating cognitive resources during its preclinical phase might prevent progression to dementia. Objective: To evaluate the effects of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS) combined with an associative episodic memory training on OLM in MCI patients and in healthy elderly (HE). Methods: In a single-blind cross-over design, 16 MCI patients and 32 HE underwent a 3-day visuospatial OLM training paired with either 20 min or 30 s (sham) atDCS (1 mA, right temporoparietal cortex). Effects on immediate (training success) and long-term memory (1-month) were investigated by conducting Mixed Model analyses. In addition, the impact of combined intervention on within-session (online) and on between-session (offline) performance were explored. Results: OLM training+atDCS enhanced training success only in MCI patients, but not HE (difference n.s.). Relative performance gain was similar in MCI patients compared to HE under atDCS. No beneficial effect was found after 1-month. Exploratory analyses suggested a positive impact on online, but a negative effect on offline performance in MCI patients. In both groups, exploratory post-hoc analyses indicated an association between initially low-performers and greater benefit from atDCS. Conclusion: Cognitive training in MCI may be enhanced by atDCS, but further delineation of the impact of current brain state, as well as temporal characteristics of multi-session atDCS-training application, may be needed to induce longer-lasting effects.

N2  - Background: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele is a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Computer-based training programs can improve cognitive performance in elderly populations. However, the effects of computer-based interventions on MCI APOE ε4 carriers have never been studied before. Objective: The effects of different web-based interventions and the APOE isoform-specific differences in training outcomes are investigated. Methods: Using a quasi-experimental study design, 202 participants with MCI aged 60 years and older took part in three different intervention programs (physical and cognitive [Long-Lasting Memories, or LLM], cognitive [Active Control, or AC], or physical intervention [Physical Training Control, or PTC]) via an innovative information and communication technologies exergaming platform. Participants in each interventional group were subdivided into APOE ε4 carriers and non-APOE ε4 carriers. All participants underwent an extensive neuropsychological evaluation before and after the training, blood tests, and brain imaging. Results: All interventions resulted in multiple statistically significant cognitive benefits after the intervention. Verbal learning (California Verbal Learning Test: immediate recall test score-LLM: P = .04; AC: P P = .03; PTC: P = .02 and P = .006, respectively), and long-term memory (California Verbal Learning Test: delayed recall test score-LLM: P = .02; AC: P = .002; and PTC: P = .02) were improved. There was no statistically significant difference among the intervention effects. APOE ε4 presence moderates intervention effects as the LLM intervention improved only their task-switching processing speed (Trail Making Test, Part B: P = .03) and the PTC intervention improved only the working memory (digit span backward: P = .03). No significant performance alteration was noted for the APOE ε4+ cognitive AC training group. Conclusions: None of the applied interventions could be identified as the optimal one; it is suggested, however, that combined cognitive and physical training and physical training via exergaming may be more effective for the high-risk MCI ΑPOE ε4+ subgroup.

N2  - Objective:We investigated if a 5-week computerized adaptive working memory training program (Cogmed® ) of 20 to 25 sessions would be effective in improving the working memory capacity and other neuropsychological functions compared to a non-adaptive working memory training program (active-controlled) in adult patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: This randomized double-blinded active control trial included 68 individuals aged 43 to 88 years, 45 men and 23 women, who were diagnosed with MCI at four Memory clinics. The study sample was randomized by block randomization to either adaptive or non-adaptive computerized working memory training. All participants completed the training, and were assessed with a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery before the intervention, and at 1 and 4 months after training. Results: Compared to the non-adaptive training group, the adaptive training group did not show significantly greater improvement on the main outcome of working memory performance at 1 and 4 months after training. Conclusion: No difference were found between the two types of training on the primary outcome of working memory, or on secondary outcomes of cognitive function domains, in this sample of MCI patients. Hence, the hypothesis that the adaptive training program would lead to greater improvements compared to the non-adaptive training program was not supported. Within group analyses was not performed due to the stringent RCT design. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Cognitive decline in aging is a pressing issue associated with significant healthcare costs and deterioration in quality of life. Previously, we reported the successful use of a novel brain-computer interface (BCI) training system in improving symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Here, we examine the feasibility of the BCI system with a new game that incorporates memory training in improving memory and attention in a pilot sample of healthy elderly. This study investigates the safety, usability and acceptability of our BCI system to elderly, and obtains an efficacy estimate to warrant a phase III trial. Thirty-one healthy elderly were randomized into intervention (n = 15) and waitlist control arms (n = 16). Intervention consisted of an 8-week training comprising 24 half-hour sessions. A usability and acceptability questionnaire was administered at the end of training. Safety was investigated by querying users about adverse events after every session. Efficacy of the system was measured by the change of total score from the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) before and after training. Feedback on the usability and acceptability questionnaire was positive. No adverse events were reported for all participants across all sessions. Though the median difference in the RBANS change scores between arms was not statistically significant, an effect size of 0.6SD was obtained, which reflects potential clinical utility according to Simon’s randomized phase II trial design. Pooled data from both arms also showed that the median change in total scores pre and post-training was statistically significant (Mdn = 4.0; p  0.001). Specifically, there were significant improvements in immediate memory (p = 0.038), visuospatial/constructional (p = 0.014), attention (p = 0.039), and delayed memory (p,0.001) scores. Our BCI-based system shows promise in improving memory and attention in healthy elderly, and appears to be safe, user-friendly and acceptable to senior users. Given the efficacy signal, a phase III trial is warranted. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objectives: The Long Lasting Memories (LLM) program concerns a newly integrated platform which combines cognitive exercises with physical activity within the context of advanced technologies. The main objective of this study was to present the preliminary results that determine the possible effectiveness of the LLM program in the improvement of cognitive functions and symptoms of depression in healthy elderly and subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Method: Fifty healthy and MCI subjects participated in the study. All of them received one hour's physical training and 35 minutes’ cognitive training, 3 times a week, during the 12 weeks of the program. Before and after the intervention all participants were assessed using a battery of neuropsychological tests. Results: The results showed a significant improvement after the LLM training in global cognitive function, in verbal memory, in attention, in episodic memory and symptoms of depression. Conclusion: This study indicates that LLM is a promising solution for older adults with and without cognitive impairment, maintaining their wellbeing with few professional and technical requirements.

N2  - Assistive technology including virtual reality and augmented reality has gained interest as a novel intervention in a range of clinical settings. This technology has the potential to provide mental stimulation, a connection to autobiographical memory through reminiscence, and enhanced quality of life (QoL) to people living with dementia (PLWD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In this mini-review, we examine the available evidence from studies reporting on the potential benefits of virtual and augmented reality to provide enjoyable, leisurely activities that may promote QoL and psychological well-being and facilitate social interaction. In total, 10 studies of varying study designs and durations (5 min to 6 months) using virtual (n = 9) and augmented reality (n = 1) were examined in PLWD (n = 6) and MCI (n = 3), in addition to 1 study that included participants with both conditions. Overall, the virtual experiences were enjoyed by the participants, improved their mood and apathy, and were preferred when compared with nonvirtual experiences. However, small sample sizes and variations in study design limit the generalizability of the results. Nevertheless, the use of virtual and augmented reality technology for PLWD and MCI is a novel and emerging method which may provide cognitive stimulation and improve well-being. Future research should explore the potential application of this technology to promote social interaction in both the community and aged care settings. We suggest future studies in PLWD and MCI assess the effects of more sustained use of virtual and augmented reality technology on psychological outcomes including QoL, apathy, and depressive symptoms, with the incorporation of physiological biomarker outcomes.

N2  - Background: Dementia affects 35 million people worldwide and is currently incurable. Many cases may be preventable because regular participation in physical, mental and social leisure activities during middle age is associated with up to 47% dementia risk reduction. However, the majority of middle-aged adults are not active enough. MCI is therefore a clear target for activity interventions aimed at reducing dementia risk. An active lifestyle during middle age reduces dementia risk but it remains to be determined if increased activity reduces dementia risk when MCI is already evident. Before this can be investigated conclusively, complex multimodal activity programmes are required that (1) combine multiple health promoting activities, (2) engage people with MCI, and (3) result in sufficient adherence rates. Methods: We designed the ThinkingFit programme to engage people with MCI in a complex intervention comprised of three activity components: physical activity, group-based cognitive stimulation (GCST) and individual cognitive stimulation (ICST). Engagement and adherence was promoted by applying specific psychological techniques to enhance behavioural flexibility in an early pre-phase and during the course of the intervention. To pilot the intervention, participants served as their own controls during a 6- to 12-week run-in period, which was followed by 12 weeks of activity intervention. Results: Out of 212 MCI patients screened, 163 were eligible, 70 consented and 67 completed the intervention (mean age 74 years). Activity adherence rates were high: physical activity = 71%; GCST = 83%; ICST = 67%. Significant treatment effects (p < .05) were evident on physical health outcomes (decreased BMI and systolic blood pressure, [pre/post values of 26.3/25.9 kg/m² and 145/136 mmHg respectively]), fitness (decreased resting and recovery heart rate [68/65 bpm and 75/69 bpm]), and cognition (improved working memory [5.3/6.3 items]). Conclusions: We found satisfactory recruitment, retention and engagement rates, coupled with significant treatment effects in elderly MCI patients. It appears feasible to conduct randomized controlled trials of the dementia prevention potential of complex multimodal activity programmes like ThinkingFit.

N2  - As the demographic structure in western societies ages, the prevalence and impact of cognitive decline rises. Thus, new solutions to tackle this problem are required. The use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)-based cognitive exercises has emerged in the last few decades, though with inconsistent results. Hence, we conducted a pre-post treatment study to further investigate this approach. We designed a set of virtual reality exercises that mimic activities of daily living by which the patient can train different cognitive domains. Twenty-five participants, ages 65–85, underwent 12 training sessions between the pre-treatment and post-treatment assessments. Significant increases were seen between the two assessments for some of the neuropsychological measures: visual memory, attention, and cognitive flexibility. Results also suggest that participants with lower baseline cognitive performance levels improved most after these sessions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of memory complaints on quality of life (QOL) in elderly community dwellers with or without mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: Participants included 120 normal controls (NC) and 37 with MCI aged 65 and over. QOL was measured using the Japanese version of Satisfaction in Daily Life, and memory complaints were measured using a questionnaire consisting of four items. The relevance of QOL was evaluated with psychological factors of personality traits, sense of self‐efficacy, depressive mood, self‐evaluation of daily functioning, range of social activities (Life‐Space Assessment), social network size, and cognitive functions including memory. The predictors of QOL were analyzed by multiple linear regression analysis. Results: QOL was not significantly different between the NC and MCI groups. In both groups, QOL was positively correlated with self‐efficacy, daily functioning, social network size, Life‐Space Assessment, and the personality traits of extraversion and agreeableness; QOL was negatively correlated with memory complaints, depressive mood, and the personality trait of neuroticism. In regression analysis, memory complaints were a negative predictor of QOL in the MCI group, but not in the NC group. The partial correlation coefficient between QOL and memory complaints was −0.623 (P < 0.05), after scores of depressive mood and self‐efficacy were controlled. Depressive mood was a common negative predictor in both groups. Positive predictors were Life‐Space Assessment in the NC group and sense of self‐efficacy in the MCI group. Conclusions: Memory complaints exerted a negative impact on self‐rated QOL in the MCI group, whereas a negative correlation was weak in the NC group. Memory training has been widely practised in individuals with MCI to prevent the development of dementia. However, such approaches inevitably identify their memory deficits and could aggravate their awareness of memory decline. Thus, it is critical to give sufficient consideration not to reduce QOL in the intervention for those with MCI. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The mammalian hippocampus shows marked decline in function with aging across many species, including humans and laboratory rodent models. This decline frequently manifests in memory impairments that occur even in the absence of dementia pathology. In humans, a number of factors correlate with preserved hippocampal memory in aging, such as exercise, cognitive stimulation and number of social ties. While interventional studies and animal models clearly indicate that exercise and cognitive stimulation lead to hippocampal preservation, there is relatively little research on whether a decline in social ties leads to cognitive decline or vice versa. Even in animal studies of environmental enrichment in aging, the focus typically falls on physical enrichment such as a rotating cast of toys, rather than the role of social interactions. The present studies investigated the hypothesis that a greater number of social ties in aging mice would lead to improved hippocampal function. Aged, female C57/Bl6 mice were housed for 3 months in pairs or large groups (7 mice per cage). Group-housed mice showed greater novel object location memory and stronger preference for a spatial navigation strategy in the Barnes maze, though no difference in escape latency, compared to pair-housed mice. Group-housed mice did not differ from pair-housed mice in basal corticosterone levels or adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Group-housed mice did, however, show reduced numbers of Iba1/CD68 + microglia in the hippocampus. These findings suggest that group housing led to better memory function and reduced markers of neuroinflammation in aged mice. More broadly, they support a causative link between social ties and hippocampal function, suggesting that merely having a larger social network can positively influence the aging brain. Future research should address the molecular mechanisms by which a greater number of social ties alters hippocampal function. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)
