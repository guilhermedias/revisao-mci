AB  - Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) occurs along a continuum from normal cognition to 
      dementia. A roadblock to earlier diagnosis and potential treatment is the lack of 
      consistency with screening for MCI. Universal screening would be ideal, but is 
      limited. Once a diagnosis of MCI is made, it is important for the clinician to 
      evaluate for reversible causes. At present time, there are no pharmacologic 
      treatments proven to slow or cure progression of MCI to dementia; nonetheless, there 
      is evidence that lifestyle modifications including diet, exercise, and cognitive 
      stimulation may be effective.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread worldwide and has had 
      unprecedented effects in healthcare systems, economies and society. COVID-19 
      clinical presentation primarily affects the respiratory system causing bilateral 
      pneumonia, but it is increasingly being recognized as a systemic disease, with 
      neurologic manifestations reported in patients with mild symptoms but, most 
      frequently, in those in a severe condition. Elderly individuals are at high risk of 
      developing severe forms of COVID-19 due to factors associated with aging and a 
      higher prevalence of medical comorbidities and, therefore, they are more vulnerable 
      to possible lasting neuropsychiatric and cognitive impairments. Several reports have 
      described insomnia, depressed mood, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and 
      cognitive impairment in a proportion of patients after discharge from the hospital. 
      The potential mechanisms underlying these symptoms are not fully understood but are 
      probably multifactorial, involving direct neurotrophic effect of SARS-CoV-2, 
      consequences of long intensive care unit stays, the use of mechanical ventilation 
      and sedative drugs, brain hypoxia, systemic inflammation, secondary effects of 
      medications used to treat COVID-19 and dysfunction of peripheral organs. Chronic 
      diseases such as dementia are a particular concern not only because they are 
      associated with higher rates of hospitalization and mortality but also because 
      COVID-19 further exacerbates the vulnerability of those with cognitive impairment. 
      In patients with dementia, COVID-19 frequently has an atypical presentation with 
      mental status changes complicating the early identification of cases. COVID-19 has 
      had a dramatical impact in long-term care facilities, where rates of infection and 
      mortality have been very high. Community measures implemented to slow the spread of 
      the virus have forced to social distancing and cancelation of cognitive stimulation 
      programs, which may have contributed to generate loneliness, behavioral symptoms and 
      worsening of cognition in patients with dementia. COVID-19 has impacted the 
      functioning of Memory Clinics, research programs and clinical trials in the 
      Alzheimer's field, triggering the implementation of telemedicine. COVID-19 survivors 
      should be periodically evaluated with comprehensive cognitive and neuropsychiatric 
      assessments, and specific mental health and cognitive rehabilitation programs should 
      be provided for those suffering long-term cognitive and psychiatric sequelae.

TI  - Telehealth Home Support During COVID-19 Confinement for Community-Dwelling Older 
      Adults With Mild Cognitive Impairment or Mild Dementia: Survey Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The public health emergency of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is rapidly 
      evolving worldwide; some countries, including Spain, have implemented restrictive 
      measures. Populations that are vulnerable to this outbreak and its physical and 
      mental health effects include community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive 
      impairment or mild dementia. Telehealth is a potential tool to deliver health care 
      and decrease exposure risk. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to explore the 
      impact of confinement on the health and well-being of community-dwelling older 
      adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, to provide television-based 
      and telephone-based health and social support, and to study the effects of a 
      television-based assistive integrated technology, TV-AssistDem (TeleVision-based 
      ASSistive Integrated Service to supporT European adults living with mild DEMentia or 
      mild cognitive impairment). METHODS: A telephone-based survey was administered in 
      Spain to 93 participants in the TV-AssistDem clinical trial from March 25 to April 
      6, 2020. RESULTS: Of the respondents, 60/93 (65%) were women. The mean age was 73.34 
      (SD 6.07), and 69/93 (74%) lived accompanied. Lockdown measures forced 17/93 
      respondents (18%) to change their living arrangements. Health status was found to be 
      optimal in 89/93 respondents (96%), with no COVID-19 symptoms. Grocery and pharmacy 
      outings were performed by family members of 68/93 participants (73%); 57 (61%) 
      reported overall well-being, and 65 (70%) maintained their sleep quality. However, 
      participants living alone reported greater negative feelings and more sleeping 
      problems. Regarding leisure activities, 53/93 respondents (57%) took walks, 32 (35%) 
      played memory games, 55 (60%) watched television, and 91 (98%) telephoned relatives. 
      58/93 (64%) respondents reported accessing moderate or too much COVID-19 
      information, 89 (97%) received it from television, and 56 (62%) stated that their 
      understanding of the information was extreme. 39/93 (39%) respondents had contacted 
      health and social services, while 29 (31%) requested information regarding these 
      services during the telephone call. There were no significant differences in health 
      and well-being between the intervention and control groups. Respondents with 
      TV-AssistDem performed more memory exercises (24/93, 52% vs 8/93, 17.4%; P<.001) 
      than control respondents. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that during COVID-19 
      confinement, the physical and mental health and well-being was optimal for the 
      majority of our vulnerable population. However, those living alone reported greater 
      negative psychological effects and sleeping problems. Measures adopted to address 
      the negative experiences of confinement included keeping informed about the 
      situation, accessing health and social services, having a support network that 
      prevents risk of exposure to COVID-19 and guarantees food and medical supplies, a 
      daily routine with maintained sleeping habits and leisure activities, staying 
      physically and mentally active with cognitive stimulation exercises, and ensuring 
      social connectedness using technology. Television sets were preferred technological 
      devices to access COVID-19 information, watch television as a recreational activity, 
      and perform memory exercises as an intellectual activity. Television-based 
      telehealth support using TV-AssistDem demonstrated potential for cognitive 
      stimulation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03653234;

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aging of posture and balance function alters the quality of life in 
      older people and causes serious problems in terms of public health and 
      socio-economic costs for our modern societies. METHOD: This article reviews the 
      various causes of imbalance and dizziness in the elderly, and considers how to 
      prevent falls, and how to rehabilitate a faller subject in order to regain a good 
      quality of life. Two effective ways of intervention are discussed, emphasizing the 
      crucial role of physical activity and cognitive stimulation, classic or using the 
      latest technical advances in virtual reality and video games. RESULTS: Fall in the 
      elderly result from aging mechanisms acting on both the sensorimotor and cognitive 
      spheres. The structural and functional integrity of the peripheral sensory receptors 
      and the musculoskeletal system deteriorate with age. The brain ages and the 
      executive functions, memory, learning, cortical processing of information, sharing 
      of attentional resources and concentration, are modified in the elderly. 
      Psychological affective factors such as depression, anxiety and stress contribute 
      also to speed up the sensorimotor and cognitive decline. The rehabilitation of the 
      postural balance in the elderly must take into account all of these components. 
      CONCLUSION: The aging of the population and the increased of lifespan are a 
      challenge for our modern societies regarding the major health and socio-economic 
      questions they raise. The fall in the elderly being one of the dramatic consequences 
      of the aging equilibration function, it is therefore imperative to develop 
      rehabilitation procedures of balance.

TI  - Cognitive stimulation to improve cognitive functioning in people with dementia.
PG  - CD005562
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD005562.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive stimulation is an intervention for people with dementia which 
      offers a range of enjoyable activities providing general stimulation for thinking, 
      concentration and memory usually in a social setting, such as a small group. Its 
      roots can be traced back to Reality Orientation (RO), which was developed in the 
      late 1950s as a response to confusion and disorientation in older patients in 
      hospital units in the USA. RO emphasised the engagement of nursing assistants in a 
      hopeful, therapeutic process but became associated with a rigid, confrontational 
      approach to people with dementia, leading to its use becoming less and less 
      common.Cognitive stimulation is often discussed in normal ageing as well as in 
      dementia. This reflects a general view that lack of cognitive activity hastens 
      cognitive decline. With people with dementia, cognitive stimulation attempts to make 
      use of the positive aspects of RO whilst ensuring that the stimulation is 
      implemented in a sensitive, respectful and person-centred manner.There is often 
      little consistency in the application and availability of psychological therapies in 
      dementia services, so a systematic review of the available evidence regarding 
      cognitive stimulation is important in order to identify its effectiveness and to 
      place practice recommendations on a sound evidence base. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the 
      effectiveness and impact of cognitive stimulation interventions aimed at improving 
      cognition for people with dementia, including any negative effects. SEARCH METHODS: 
      The trials were identified from a search of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive 
      Improvement Group Specialized Register, called ALOIS (updated 6 December 2011). The 
      search terms used were: cognitive stimulation, reality orientation, memory therapy, 
      memory groups, memory support, memory stimulation, global stimulation, cognitive 
      psychostimulation. Supplementary searches were performed in a number of major 
      healthcare databases and trial registers to ensure that the search was up to date 
      and comprehensive. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of 
      cognitive stimulation for dementia which incorporated a measure of cognitive change 
      were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted independently by 
      two review authors using a previously tested data extraction form. Study authors 
      were contacted for data not provided in the papers. Two review authors conducted 
      independent assessments of the risk of bias in included studies. MAIN RESULTS: 
      Fifteen RCTs were included in the review. Six of these had been included in the 
      previous review of RO. The studies included participants from a variety of settings, 
      interventions that were of varying duration and intensity, and were from several 
      different countries. The quality of the studies was generally low by current 
      standards but most had taken steps to ensure assessors were blind to treatment 
      allocation. Data were entered in the meta-analyses for 718 participants (407 
      receiving cognitive stimulation, 311 in control groups). The primary analysis was on 
      changes that were evident immediately at the end of the treatment period. A few 
      studies provided data allowing evaluation of whether any effects were subsequently 
      maintained. A clear, consistent benefit on cognitive function was associated with 
      cognitive stimulation (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.41, 95% CI 0.25 to 
      0.57). This remained evident at follow-up one to three months after the end of 
      treatment. In secondary analyses with smaller total sample sizes, benefits were also 
      noted on self-reported quality of life and well-being (standardised mean difference: 
      0.38 [95% CI: 0.11, 0.65]); and on staff ratings of communication and social 
      interaction (SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.71). No differences in relation to mood 
      (self-report or staff-rated), activities of daily living, general behavioural 
      function or problem behaviour were noted. In the few studies reporting family 
      caregiver outcomes, no differences were noted. Importantly, there was no indication 
      of increased strain on family caregivers in the one study where they were trained to 
      deliver the intervention. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There was consistent evidence from 
      multiple trials that cognitive stimulation programmes benefit cognition in people 
      with mild to moderate dementia over and above any medication effects. However, the 
      trials were of variable quality with small sample sizes and only limited details of 
      the randomisation method were apparent in a number of the trials. Other outcomes 
      need more exploration but improvements in self-reported quality of life and 
      well-being were promising. Further research should look into the potential benefits 
      of longer term cognitive stimulation programmes and their clinical significance.

TI  - Simultaneous Aerobic Exercise and Memory Training Program in Older Adults with 
      Subjective Memory Impairments.
PG  - 795-806
LID - 10.3233/JAD-170846 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several modifiable lifestyle factors have been shown to have potential 
      beneficial effects in slowing cognitive decline. Two such factors that may affect 
      cognitive performance and slow the progression of memory loss into dementia in older 
      adults are cognitive training and physical activity. There are currently no 
      effective treatments for dementia; therefore, preventative strategies to delay or 
      prevent the onset of dementia are of critical importance. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this 
      study was to determine the relative effectiveness of simultaneous performance of 
      memory training and aerobic exercise to a sequential performance intervention on 
      memory functioning in older adults. METHODS: 55 older adults (aged 60- 75) with 
      subjective memory impairments (non-demented and non-MCI) completed the intervention 
      that consisted of 90-minute small group classes held twice weekly. Participants were 
      randomized to either 4-weeks of supervised strategy-based memory training done 
      simultaneously while stationary cycling (SIM) or sequentially after the stationary 
      cycling (SEQ). Standardized neurocognitive measures of memory, executive 
      functioning, speed of processing, attention, and cognitive flexibility were assessed 
      at baseline and post-intervention. RESULTS: The SIM group, but not the SEQ group, 
      had a significant improvement on composite memory following the intervention 
      (t(51) = 2.7, p = 0.01, effect size (ES) = 0.42) and transfer to non-trained 
      reasoning abilities (t(51) = 6.0, ES = 0.49) and complex attention (t(51) = 3.1, 
      p = 0.003, ES = 0.70). Conversely, the SEQ group, but not the SIM, showed 
      significant improvement in executive functioning (t(51) = 5.0, p = 0.0001, 
      ES = 0.96). CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that a 4-week simultaneous memory 
      training and aerobic exercise program is sufficient to improve memory, attention, 
      and reasoning abilities in older adults.

TI  - A Mini-Review of Virtual Reality-Based Interventions to Promote Well-Being for 
      People Living with Dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment.
PG  - 430-440
LID - 10.1159/000500040 [doi]
AB  - Assistive technology including virtual reality and augmented reality has gained 
      interest as a novel intervention in a range of clinical settings. This technology 
      has the potential to provide mental stimulation, a connection to autobiographical 
      memory through reminiscence, and enhanced quality of life (QoL) to people living 
      with dementia (PLWD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In this mini-review, we 
      examine the available evidence from studies reporting on the potential benefits of 
      virtual and augmented reality to provide enjoyable, leisurely activities that may 
      promote QoL and psychological well-being and facilitate social interaction. In 
      total, 10 studies of varying study designs and durations (5 min to 6 months) using 
      virtual (n = 9) and augmented reality (n = 1) were examined in PLWD (n = 6) and MCI 
      (n= 3), in addition to 1 study that included participants with both conditions. 
      Overall, the virtual experiences were enjoyed by the participants, improved their 
      mood and apathy, and were preferred when compared with nonvirtual experiences. 
      However, small sample sizes and variations in study design limit the 
      generalizability of the results. Nevertheless, the use of virtual and augmented 
      reality technology for PLWD and MCI is a novel and emerging method which may provide 
      cognitive stimulation and improve well-being. Future research should explore the 
      potential application of this technology to promote social interaction in both the 
      community and aged care settings. We suggest future studies in PLWD and MCI assess 
      the effects of more sustained use of virtual and augmented reality technology on 
      psychological outcomes including QoL, apathy, and depressive symptoms, with the 
      incorporation of physiological biomarker outcomes.

BTI - Screening for Cognitive Impairment in Older Adults: An Evidence Update for the U.S. 
      Preventive Services Task Force
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We conducted this systematic review to support the U.S. Preventive 
      Services Task Force (USPSTF) in updating its recommendation on screening for 
      cognitive impairment in older adults. Our review addresses five questions: 1) Does 
      screening for cognitive impairment in community-dwelling older adults improve 
      decisionmaking, patient, family/caregiver, or societal outcomes?; 2) What is the 
      test performance of screening instruments to detect dementia or mild cognitive 
      impairment (MCI) in community-dwelling older adult primary care patients?; 3) What 
      are the harms of screening for cognitive impairment?; 4) Do interventions for early 
      dementia or MCI in older adults improve decisionmaking, patient, family/caregiver, 
      or societal outcomes?; and 5) What are the harms of interventions for cognitive 
      impairment? DATA SOURCES: We reviewed 12 relevant existing systematic reviews; 
      database searches through December 2012 in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane 
      Central Register of Controlled Trials; and additional searches for ongoing trials 
      through ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials 
      Registry Platform, and Current Controlled Trials (ISRCTN Register). STUDY SELECTION: 
      We conducted dual independent review of 16,179 abstracts and 1,190 articles against 
      the specified inclusion criteria, including: screening instruments that could be 
      delivered in primary care in 10 minutes or less by a clinician or self-administered 
      in 20 minutes or less; diagnostic accuracy studies that used a reference standard; 
      screening studies conducted in unselected community-dwelling older adults relevant 
      to primary care in the United States; major pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic 
      interventions in people with MCI or mild to moderate dementia; intervention trials 
      of efficacy; or trials and large observational studies examining adverse effects. 
      DATA ANALYSIS: We conducted dual independent critical appraisal of all included 
      studies, and extracted all important study details and outcomes from fair- or 
      good-quality studies. For diagnostic accuracy studies, we focused on sensitivity and 
      specificity of instruments that were evaluated in more than one study. For treatment 
      trials, we synthesized results by intervention type. We conducted a qualitative 
      synthesis of results using summary tables and figures to capture key study 
      characteristics, sources of clinical heterogeneity, and overall results of each 
      study. Quantitative synthesis was limited to test performance of the Mini Mental 
      State Examination (MMSE) (due to insufficient number of homogeneous studies for 
      other instruments) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications 
      to treat AD and other medications and dietary supplements on global cognitive 
      outcomes; caregiver interventions on caregiver burden and depression outcomes; and 
      nonpharmacologic interventions aimed at the patient on global cognitive outcomes. 
      RESULTS: Screening (Key Questions 1–3): No trials examined the direct effect of 
      screening for cognitive impairment on important patient outcomes, including patient, 
      caregiver, and clinician decisionmaking outcomes. We identified 55 studies that 
      addressed the diagnostic accuracy and harms of brief screening instruments to detect 
      cognitive impairment. Most instruments were only studied in a handful of 
      well-designed diagnostic accuracy studies in primary care—relevant populations. The 
      MMSE remains the most thoroughly studied instrument. Pooled estimates across 14 
      studies (n=10,185) resulted in 88.3 percent sensitivity (95% CI, 81.3 to 92.9) and 
      86.2 specificity (95% CI, 81.8 to 89.7) for a cut-point of 23/24 or 24/25 to detect 
      dementia. Other instruments with more limited evidence to detect dementia include 
      the Clock Drawing Test (CDT) (k=7; n=2,509), Mini-Cog (k=4; n=1,570), Memory 
      Impairment Screen (MIS) (k=5; n=1,971), Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT) (k=4; n=824), 
      Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) (k=4; n=1,057), Free and Cued 
      Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) (k=2- n=734), 7-Minute Screen (7MS) (k=2; n=553), 
      Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) (k=2; n=677) and Informant 
      Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) (k=5; n=1,108). In 
      general, these tests can have reasonable test performance, but the range of 
      sensitivity and specificity varies across the studies likely due to clinical 
      heterogeneity. The best-quality studies for the MIS and AMT show low sensitivity. 
      The AMT, SPMSQ, FCRST, 7MS, and TICS have very limited evidence in English. Much 
      more limited evidence exists for the following instruments to detect MCI: MMSE 
      (k=15; n=5,758), IQCODE (k=4; n=975), CDT (k=4; n=4,191), Mini-Cog (k=3; n=1,092), 
      TICS (k=3; n=568), and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (k=2; n=251). The 
      sensitivity and/or specificity of these instruments is generally worse for the 
      detection of MCI compared with dementia. Other instruments (i.e., 6-Item Screener, 
      Visual Association Test, General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition, activities of 
      daily living/instrumental activities of daily living, Benton's Orientation Test, 
      Delayed Recall Test, and the Short Concord Informant Dementia Scale for dementia; 
      AD8, St. Louis University Mental Status Exam, and Computer Assessment of Mild 
      Cognitive Impairment for MCI) appear promising; however, their test performance has 
      not been reproduced in other primary care–relevant populations. No studies directly 
      addressed the adverse psychological effects of screening or adverse effects from 
      false-positive or false-negative testing. One fair-quality study found that 
      approximately half the older adults who screened positive for cognitive impairment 
      refused to complete a formal diagnostic workup. Treatment (Key Questions 4–5): We 
      identified one systematic review and 131 additional studies that addressed the 
      treatment or management of mild to moderate dementia and/or MCI. Pharmacologic 
      Interventions: Overall, based on one systematic review (50 trials) and 14 
      subsequently published trials evaluating donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, and 
      memantine in people with mild to moderate dementia, these medications can improve 
      global cognitive function in people with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in the short-term. 
      However, the magnitude of these changes is small, at approximately 1- to 3-point 
      change on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog). 
      The average effect of these changes is likely not clinically meaningful using 
      commonly accepted values to interpret the clinical importance of these changes 
      (4-point change on ADAS-cog over 6 months). Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors 
      (AchEIs), but not memantine, appear to consistently improve measures of global 
      functioning in people with AD in the short-term. Adverse effects from AChEIs are 
      common. While there does not appear to be a difference in total serious adverse 
      events for these medications across randomized trials, estimates of total serious 
      adverse events appear higher in observational studies than in the trials. Trials 
      evaluating other medications or dietary supplements (k=26; n=5,000), including 
      low-dose aspirin, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (simvastatin and atorvastatin), 
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, naproxen, indomethacin, and 
      celecoxib), gonadal steroids (estrogen plus or minus progesterone and testosterone), 
      and dietary supplements (multivitamins, B vitamins, vitamin E plus or minus vitamin 
      C, and omega-3 fatty acids) showed no benefit on global cognitive or physical 
      function in people with mild to moderate dementia or MCI. Nonpharmacologic 
      Interventions: We identified 59 fair- to good-quality trials evaluating the effect 
      of multiple different types of interventions primarily aimed at the caregiver or the 
      patient-caregiver dyad. Complex psychoeducational caregiver interventions (k=48; 
      n=8,216) generally showed a small benefit (standardized effect size, approximately 
      0.2) on caregiver burden and depression outcomes. Although findings were somewhat 
      inconsistent across cognitive intervention trials (k=15; n=1,128), cognitive 
      stimulation plus or minus cognitive training appears to improve global cognitive 
      function in the short-term for both people with MCI or dementia. Our ability to 
      determine the magnitude and certainty of this benefit, however, is impeded by the 
      limited number of trials and clinical (and statistical) heterogeneity, as well as 
      the very wide confidence intervals (ranging from clinically not meaningful to a 
      large effect). Harms were not reported in the included trials for caregiver or 
      cognitive interventions. Exercise intervention trials (k=10; n=1,033) showed no 
      consistent benefit on global cognitive outcomes or patient depression outcomes in 
      people with MCI or mild to moderate dementia. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include 
      limited reproducibility of the test performance of instruments that are feasible to 
      use in primary care; differences in estimates of test performance, which may be due 
      to differences in populations or administration and scoring (choice of cut-point) of 
      the instrument itself; and lack of clarity and standardization of defining MCI in 
      diagnostic accuracy studies. Research in treatment of dementia other than AD is 
      limited, and the average treatment effects of benefit for FDA-approved medications 
      for AD and intensive interventions are small and generally in people with moderate 
      dementia; thus, it is difficult to interpret its clinical importance and 
      applicability for screen-detected patients. Other important measures of global 
      functioning, such as health-related quality of life, global physical functioning, 
      emergent or unexpected health care utilization, and institutionalization, are 
      generally inconsistently reported. CONCLUSIONS: We found no trial evidence that 
      examined the effect of screening for cognitive impairment on patient, caregiver, or 
      clinician decisionmaking or important patient, caregiver, or societal outcomes. 
      Several brief screening instruments can adequately detect dementia, especially in 
      populations with a higher prevalence of underlying dementia. Despite the size of 
      this body of literature, only a handful of instruments have been studied as 
      screening tests in more than one study. AChEIs, memantine, complex caregiver 
      interventions, and cognitive stimulation all have evidence to support their use in 
      mild to moderate dementia, specifically AD. However, the clinical importance of 
      their benefit is unclear because the average effects of benefit observed in trials 
      was small or had a large amount of imprecision.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a phase in cognitive decline when it 
      is still possible to intervene to reverse the decline. Cognitive stimulation 
      delivered through psychosocial interventions provides both psychological 
      intervention and social stimulation to improve cognition. A pilot open-label 
      parallel-arms randomized controlled trial was undertaken to examine the effects of 
      art therapy (AT) and music reminiscence activity (MRA) compared to the control, on 
      the primary outcome of neurocognitive domain assessments in elderly people with MCI. 
      METHODS: Community-living elderly people with MCI (Petersen's criteria), assessed 
      for study eligibility, were randomized using a web-based system with equal 
      allocation to two intervention arms: AT (guided viewing of art pieces and production 
      of visual arts) and MRA (listening, and recalling memories related to music) and a 
      control arm (standard care without any intervention). Interventions were led by 
      trained therapists weekly for 3 months, then fortnightly for 6 months. 
      Neurocognitive domains (mean of memory, attention, and visuo-spatial abilities 
      standardized scores), psychological wellbeing (subsyndromal depression and anxiety) 
      and telomere length as a biological marker of cellular ageing, were assessed by 
      intervention-blinded assessors at baseline, 3 months and 9 months. RESULTS: In 
      total, 250 people were screened and 68 were randomized and included in the analysis. 
      In the AT arm, neurocognitive domains improved compared to the control arm at 3 
      months (mean difference (d) = 0.40; 90% CI 0.126, 0.679) and were sustained at 
      9 months (d = 0.31; 90% CI 0.068, 0.548). There was some improvement in depression 
      and anxiety at 3 and 9 months and in telomere length at 9 months, but this was not 
      significant. Similar improvements were observed in the MRA arm over the control arm, 
      but they were not significant. There were no intervention-related adverse effects. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Art therapy delivered by trained staff as "art as therapy" and "art 
      psychotherapy" may have been the significant contributor to cognitive improvements. 
      The findings support cognitive stimulation for elderly people with cognitive decline 
      and signal the need for larger studies and further investigation of carefully 
      designed psycho-social interventions for this group. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical

TI  - Computerized cognitive stimulation and engagement programs in older adults with mild 
      cognitive impairment: comparing feasibility, acceptability, and cognitive and 
      psychosocial effects.
PG  - 1967-1975
LID - 10.2147/CIA.S145769 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is associated with a higher risk of 
      dementia and is becoming a topic of interest for pharmacological and 
      nonpharmacological interventions. With advances in technology, computer-based 
      cognitive exercises are increasingly integrated into traditional cognitive 
      interventions, such as cognitive training. Another type of cognitive intervention 
      involving technology use is cognitive engagement, consisting of involving 
      participants in highly motivational and mentally challenging activities, such as 
      learning to use a form of new digital technology. This study examined the 
      feasibility and acceptability of a computerized cognitive stimulation (CCS) program 
      and a computerized cognitive engagement (CCE) program, and then compared their 
      effects in older adults with MCI. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this randomized study, 
      data from 19 MCI patients were analyzed (n=9 in CCS and n=10 in CCE). The patients 
      attended a group weekly session for a duration of 3 months. Assessments of cognitive 
      and psychosocial variables were conducted at baseline (M0) and at the end of the 
      programs (M3). RESULTS: All of the participants attended the 12 sessions and showed 
      a high level of motivation. Attrition rate was very low (one dropout at M3 
      assessment). At M3, the CCS participants displayed a significant improvement in part 
      B of the Trail Making Test (TMT-B; p=0.03) and self-esteem (p=0.005), while the CCE 
      participants showed a significant improvement in part A of the Trail Making Test 
      (TMT-A; p=0.007) and a higher level of technology acceptance (p=0.006). The two 
      groups did not differ significantly (p>0.05) in cognitive and psychosocial changes 
      after the intervention. However, medium effect sizes (Cohen's d=0.56; 95% CI 
      =-0.43:1.55) were found on the free recall, favoring the CCS group, as well as on 
      TMT-A (d=0.51; 95% CI =-0.48:1.49) and technology acceptance (d=-0.65; 95% CI 
      =-1.64:0.34), favoring the CCE group. CONCLUSION: Both interventions were highly 
      feasible and acceptable and allowed improvement in different aspects of cognitive 
      and psychosocial functioning in MCI subjects.

TI  - The quest for synergy between physical exercise and cognitive stimulation via 
      exergaming in people with dementia: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 3

AB  - BACKGROUND: Exercise is often proposed as a non-pharmacological intervention to 
      delay cognitive decline in people with dementia, but evidence remains inconclusive. 
      Previous studies suggest that combining physical exercise with cognitive stimulation 
      may be more successful in this respect. Exergaming is a promising intervention in 
      which physical exercise is combined with cognitively challenging tasks in a single 
      session. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of exergame training 
      and aerobic training on cognitive functioning in older adults with dementia. 
      METHODS: A three-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared exergame training, 
      aerobic training and an active control intervention consisting of relaxation and 
      flexibility exercises. Individuals with dementia were randomized and individually 
      trained three times a week during 12 weeks. Cognitive functioning was measured at 
      baseline, after the 12-week intervention period and at 24-week follow-up by 
      neuropsychological assessment. The domains of executive function, episodic memory, 
      working memory and psychomotor speed were evaluated. Test scores were converted into 
      standardized z-scores that were averaged per domain. Between-group differences were 
      analysed with analysis of covariance. RESULTS: Data from 115 people with dementia 
      (mean (SD) age = 79.2 (6.9) years; mean (SD) MMSE score = 22.9 (3.4)) were analysed. 
      There was a significant improvement in psychomotor speed in the aerobic and exergame 
      groups compared to the active control group (mean difference domain score (95% CI) 
      aerobic versus control 0.370 (0.103-0.637), p = 0.007; exergame versus control 0.326 
      (0.081-0.571), p = 0.009). The effect size was moderate (partial η(2) = 0.102). No 
      significant differences between the intervention and control groups were found for 
      executive functioning, episodic memory and working memory. CONCLUSIONS: To our 
      knowledge, this is the first RCT evaluating the effects of exergame training and 
      aerobic training on cognitive functioning in people with dementia. We found that 
      both exergame training and aerobic training improve psychomotor speed, compared to 
      an active control group. This finding may be clinically relevant as psychomotor 
      speed is an important predictor for functional decline. No effects were found on 
      executive function, episodic memory and working memory. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Multicomponent physical exercise with simultaneous cognitive training to enhance

AB  - BACKGROUND: About one-third of people older than 65 years fall at least once a year. 
      Physical exercise has been previously demonstrated to improve gait, enhance physical 
      fitness, and prevent falls. Nonetheless, the addition of cognitive training 
      components may potentially increase these effects, since cognitive impairment is 
      related to gait irregularities and fall risk. We hypothesized that simultaneous 
      cognitive-physical training would lead to greater improvements in dual-task (DT) 
      gait compared to exclusive physical training. METHODS: Elderly persons older than 70 
      years and without cognitive impairment were randomly assigned to the following 
      groups: 1) virtual reality video game dancing (DANCE), 2) treadmill walking with 
      simultaneous verbal memory training (MEMORY), or 3) treadmill walking (PHYS). Each 
      program was complemented with strength and balance exercises. Two 1-hour training 
      sessions per week over 6 months were applied. Gait variables, functional fitness 
      (Short Physical Performance Battery, 6-minute walk), and fall frequencies were 
      assessed at baseline, after 3 months and 6 months, and at 1-year follow-up. Multiple 
      regression analyses with planned comparisons were carried out. RESULTS: Eighty-nine 
      participants were randomized to three groups initially; 71 completed the training 
      and 47 were available at 1-year follow-up. DANCE/MEMORY showed a significant 
      advantage compared to PHYS in DT costs of step time variability at fast walking 
      (P=0.044). Training-specific gait adaptations were found on comparing DANCE and 
      MEMORY: DANCE reduced step time at fast walking (P=0.007) and MEMORY reduced gait 
      variability in DT and DT costs at preferred walking speed (both trend P=0.062). 
      Global linear time effects showed improved gait (P<0.05), functional fitness 
      (P<0.05), and reduced fall frequency (-77%, P<0.001). Only single-task fast walking, 
      gait variability at preferred walking speed, and Short Physical Performance Battery 
      were reduced at follow-up (all P<0.05 or trend). CONCLUSION: Long-term 
      multicomponent cognitive-physical and exclusive physical training programs 
      demonstrated similar potential to counteract age-related decline in physical 
      functioning.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is a health problem that concerns almost every 
      second elderly person. Physical and cognitive training have differential positive 
      effects on cognition, but have been rarely applied in combination. This study 
      evaluates synergistic effects of multicomponent physical exercise complemented with 
      novel simultaneous cognitive training on cognition in older adults. We hypothesized 
      that simultaneous cognitive-physical components would add training specific 
      cognitive benefits compared to exclusively physical training. METHODS: Seniors, 
      older than 70 years, without cognitive impairment, were randomly assigned to either: 
      1) virtual reality video game dancing (DANCE), 2) treadmill walking with 
      simultaneous verbal memory training (MEMORY), or 3) treadmill walking (PHYS). Each 
      program was complemented with strength and balance exercises. Two 1-hour training 
      sessions per week over 6 months were applied. Cognitive performance was assessed at 
      baseline, after 3 and 6 months, and at 1-year follow-up. Multiple regression 
      analyses with planned comparisons were calculated. RESULTS: Eighty-nine participants 
      were randomized to the three groups initially, 71 completed the training, while 47 
      were available at 1-year follow-up. Advantages of the simultaneous 
      cognitive-physical programs were found in two dimensions of executive function. 
      "Shifting attention" showed a time×intervention interaction in favor of DANCE/MEMORY 
      versus PHYS (F[2, 68] =1.95, trend P=0.075, r=0.17); and "working memory" showed a 
      time×intervention interaction in favor of DANCE versus MEMORY (F[1, 136] =2.71, 
      trend P=0.051, R (2)=0.006). Performance improvements in executive functions, 
      long-term visual memory (episodic memory), and processing speed were maintained at 
      follow-up in all groups. CONCLUSION: Particular executive functions benefit from 
      simultaneous cognitive-physical training compared to exclusively physical 
      multicomponent training. Cognitive-physical training programs may counteract 
      widespread cognitive impairments in the elderly.

TI  - Virtual reality-based cognitive-motor training for middle-aged adults at high 
      Alzheimer's disease risk: A randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 118-129

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ubiquity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) coupled with relatively 
      ineffectual pharmacologic treatments has spurred interest in nonpharmacologic 
      lifestyle interventions for prevention or risk reduction. However, evidence of 
      neuroplasticity notwithstanding, there are few scientifically rigorous, ecologically 
      relevant brain training studies focused on building cognitive reserve in middle age 
      to protect against cognitive decline. This pilot study will examine the ability of 
      virtual reality (VR) cognitive training to improve cognition and cerebral blood flow 
      (CBF) in middle-aged individuals at high AD risk due to parental history. METHODS: 
      The design is an assessor-blind, parallel group, randomized controlled trial of VR 
      cognitive-motor training in middle-aged adults with AD family history. The 
      experimental group will be trained with adaptive "real-world" VR tasks targeting 
      sustained and selective attention, working memory, covert rule deduction, and 
      planning, while walking on a treadmill. One active control group will perform the VR 
      tasks without treadmill walking; another will walk on a treadmill while watching 
      scientific documentaries (nonspecific cognitive stimulation). A passive (waitlist) 
      control group will not receive training. Training sessions will be 45 minutes, 
      twice/week for 12 weeks. Primary outcomes are global cognition and CBF (from 
      arterial spin labeling [ASL]) at baseline, immediately after training (training 
      gain), and 3 months post-training (maintenance gain). We aim to recruit 125 
      participants, including 20 passive controls and 35 in the other groups. DISCUSSION: 
      Current pharmacologic therapies are for symptomatic AD patients, whereas 
      nonpharmacologic training is administrable before symptom onset. Emerging evidence 
      suggests that cognitive training improves cognitive function. However, a more 
      ecologically valid cognitive-motor VR setting that better mimics complex daily 
      activities may augment transfer of trained skills. VR training has benefited 
      clinical cohorts, but benefit in asymptomatic high-risk individuals is unknown. If 
      effective, this trial may help define a prophylactic regimen for AD, adaptable for 
      home-based application in high-risk individuals.

TI  - Computerised cognitive training for maintaining cognitive function in cognitively 
      healthy people in midlife.
PG  - CD012278
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD012278.pub2 [doi]
LID - CD012278
AB  - BACKGROUND: Normal aging is associated with changes in cognitive function that are 
      non-pathological and are not necessarily indicative of future neurocognitive 
      disease. Low cognitive and brain reserve and limited cognitive stimulation are 
      associated with increased risk of dementia. Emerging evidence now suggests that 
      subtle cognitive changes, detectable years before criteria for mild cognitive 
      impairment are met, may be predictive of future dementia. Important for intervention 
      and reduction in disease risk, research also suggests that engaging in stimulating 
      mental activity throughout adulthood builds cognitive and brain reserve and reduces 
      dementia risk. Therefore, midlife (defined here as 40 to 65 years) may be a suitable 
      time to introduce cognitive interventions for maintaining cognitive function and, in 
      the longer term, possibly preventing or delaying the onset of clinical dementia. 
      OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of computerised cognitive training interventions 
      lasting at least 12 weeks for maintaining or improving cognitive function in 
      cognitively healthy people in midlife. SEARCH METHODS: We searched up to 31 March 
      2018 in ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois), the specialised register of the 
      Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG). We ran additional 
      searches in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO 
      Portal/ICTRP at www.apps.who.int/trialsearch, to ensure that the search was as 
      comprehensive and as up-to-date as possible, to identify published, unpublished, and 
      ongoing trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) 
      or quasi-RCTs, published or unpublished, reported in any language. Participants were 
      cognitively healthy people between 40 and 65 years of age (80% of study population 
      within this age range). Experimental interventions adhered to the following 
      criteria: intervention was any form of interactive computerised cognitive 
      intervention - including computer exercises, computer games, mobile devices, gaming 
      console, and virtual reality - that involved repeated practice on standardised 
      exercises of specified cognitive domain(s) for the purpose of enhancing cognitive 
      function; duration of the intervention was at least 12 weeks; cognitive outcomes 
      were measured; and cognitive training interventions were compared with active or 
      inactive control interventions. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: For preliminary 
      screening of search results, we used a 'crowd' method to identify RCTs. At least two 
      review authors working independently screened remaining citations against inclusion 
      criteria; independently extracted data; and assessed the quality of the included 
      trial, using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. We used GRADE to describe 
      the overall quality of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: We identified one eligible study 
      that examined the effect of computerised cognitive training (CCT) in 6742 
      participants over 50 years of age, with training and follow-up duration of six 
      months. We considered the study to be at high risk of attrition bias and the overall 
      quality of the evidence to be low.Researchers provided no data on our primary 
      outcome. Results indicate that there may be a small advantage for the CCT group for 
      executive function (mean difference (MD) -1.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.85 
      to -1.29; participants = 3994; low-quality evidence) and a very small advantage for 
      the control group for working memory (MD 0.09, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.15; participants = 
      5831; low-quality evidence). The intervention may have had little or no effect on 
      episodic memory (MD -0.03, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.04; participants = 3090; low-quality 
      evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found low-quality evidence from only one study. 
      We are unable to determine whether computerised cognitive training is effective in 
      maintaining global cognitive function among healthy adults in midlife. We strongly 
      recommend that high-quality studies be undertaken to investigate the effectiveness 
      and acceptability of cognitive training in midlife, using interventions that last 
      long enough that they may have enduring effects on cognitive and brain reserve, and 
      with investigators following up long enough to assess effects on clinically 
      important outcomes in later life.

TI  - Screening for cognitive impairment in older adults: A systematic review for the U.S. 
      Preventive Services Task Force.
PG  - 601-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Earlier identification of cognitive impairment may reduce patient and 
      caregiver morbidity. PURPOSE: To systematically review the diagnostic accuracy of 
      brief cognitive screening instruments and the benefits and harms of pharmacologic 
      and nonpharmacologic interventions for early cognitive impairment. DATA SOURCES: 
      MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through 
      December 2012; systematic reviews; clinical trial registries; and experts. STUDY 
      SELECTION: English-language studies of fair to good quality, primary care–feasible 
      screening instruments, and treatments aimed at persons with mild cognitive 
      impairment or mild to moderate dementia. DATA EXTRACTION: Dual quality assessment 
      and abstraction of relevant study details. DATA SYNTHESIS: The Mini-Mental State 
      Examination (k = 25) is the most thoroughly studied instrument but is not available 
      for use without cost. Publicly available instruments with adequate test performance 
      to detect dementia include the Clock Drawing Test (k = 7), Mini-Cog (k = 4), Memory 
      Impairment Screen (k = 5), Abbreviated Mental Test (k = 4), Short Portable Mental 
      Status Questionnaire (k = 4), Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (k = 2), 
      7-Minute Screen (k = 2), and Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the 
      Elderly (k = 5). Medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for 
      Alzheimer disease (k = 58) and caregiver interventions (k = 59) show a small benefit 
      of uncertain clinical importance for patients and their caregivers. Small benefits 
      are also limited by common adverse effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and 
      limited availability of complex caregiver interventions. Although promising, 
      cognitive stimulation (k = 6) and exercise (k = 10) have limited evidence to support 
      their use in persons with mild to moderate dementia or mild cognitive impairment. 
      LIMITATION: Limited studies in persons with dementia other than Alzheimer disease 
      and sparse reporting of important health outcomes. CONCLUSION: Brief instruments to 
      screen for cognitive impairment can adequately detect dementia, but there is no 
      empirical evidence that screening improves decision making. Whether interventions 
      for patients or their caregivers have a clinically significant effect in persons 
      with earlier detected cognitive impairment is still unclear. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE:

TI  - Mental awareness improved mild cognitive impairment and modulated gut microbiome.
PG  - 24371-24393
LID - 10.18632/aging.202277 [doi]
AB  - There is ample scientific and clinical evidence of the effects of gut microbiota on 
      the brain but no definitive evidence that the brain can affect changes in gut 
      microbiota under the bi-directional gut-brain axis concept. As there is no 
      pharmacotherapeutic intervention for the early stages of cognitive decline, research 
      has focused on cognitive stimulation in reversing or slowing the impairment. Elderly 
      patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment underwent a randomized-control 
      trial of mindful awareness practice. Neuropsychological assessments, inflammatory 
      markers, and gut microbiota profiles were tested. Here, we report that their 
      cognitive impairment was improved and associated with changes in gut bacterial 
      profile. A cognition-score-dependent-abundance was observed in Ruminococcus vs 
      Recognition Trials (RT), Digit Span Backward (DSB), Semantic Fluency Span (SFS) and 
      Memory Domain (MD); Coprococcus vs DSB, Color Trails Test 2 (CTT2) and Block Design 
      (BD); Parabacteroides vs DSB and SFS; Fusobacterium vs DSB and CTT2; 
      Enterobacteriaceae vs BD and SFS; Ruminococcaceae vs DSB; Phascolarctobacterium vs 
      MD. The study showed for the first-time, alteration in the cognitive capacity 
      leading to the corresponding changes in microbiota profiles. This strongly suggests 
      that signals from the different segments of brain could dictate directly or 
      indirectly the abundances of specific gut microbes.

      Preliminary Study.
PG  - 2411-2424
LID - 10.1044/2019_JSLHR-L-18-0321 [doi]
AB  - Purpose We report a preliminary study that prospectively tests the potential 
      cognitive enhancing effect of foreign language (FL) learning in older adults with no 
      clear signs of cognitive decline beyond what is age typical. Because language 
      learning engages a large brain network that overlaps with the network of cognitive 
      aging, we hypothesized that learning a new language later in life would be 
      beneficial. Method Older adults were randomly assigned to 3 training groups: FL, 
      games, and music appreciation. All were trained predominately by a computer-based 
      program for 6 months, and their cognitive abilities were tested before, immediately 
      after, and 3 months after training. Results FL and games, but not music 
      appreciation, improved overall cognitive abilities that were maintained at 3 months 
      after training. Conclusion This is the 1st randomized control study providing 
      preliminary support for the cognitive benefits of FL learning.

      generalization].
PG  - 187-195
LID - 10.1684/pnv.2020.0860 [doi]
AB  - Working memory is one of the cognitive functions that is the most sensitive to 
      normal and pathological age-related effects. In older individuals with a mild 
      cognitive impairment, deficits in working memory are frequent and can precede those 
      of episodic memory, in addition to having a strong prognostic value of evolution 
      toward a dementia of Alzheimer type. Because of its implication in numerous 
      cognitive and cognitive-motor tasks, working memory is called upon in a wide range 
      of daily life activities. Impairment in working memory therefore increases the risk 
      of a loss of autonomy. In the current review, we present different working memory 
      training programs. We show how these training programs are associated with specific 
      effects and to near and far transfers towards other cognitive functions in older 
      adults without cognitive impairment or with mild cognitive impairment, as well as in 
      patients with dementia. We show that the benefits are confirmed by neuronal 
      modifications, suggesting an improvement in the neuronal efficiency of the targeted 
      or related trained processes. Finally, we consider the central question of the 
      generalization of the cognitive gains of working memory training toward ecological 
      situations.

TI  - Adaptive Computerized Working Memory Training in Patients With Mild Cognitive

PG  - 807
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00807 [doi]
LID - 807
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated if a 5-week computerized adaptive working memory training 
      program (Cogmed(®)) of 20 to 25 sessions would be effective in improving the working 
      memory capacity and other neuropsychological functions compared to a non-adaptive 
      working memory training program (active-controlled) in adult patients with mild 
      cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: This randomized double-blinded active control 
      trial included 68 individuals aged 43 to 88 years, 45 men and 23 women, who were 
      diagnosed with MCI at four Memory clinics. The study sample was randomized by block 
      randomization to either adaptive or non-adaptive computerized working memory 
      training. All participants completed the training, and were assessed with a 
      comprehensive neuropsychological test battery before the intervention, and at 1 and 
      4 months after training. RESULTS: Compared to the non-adaptive training group, the 
      adaptive training group did not show significantly greater improvement on the main 
      outcome of working memory performance at 1 and 4 months after training. CONCLUSION: 
      No difference were found between the two types of training on the primary outcome of 
      working memory, or on secondary outcomes of cognitive function domains, in this 
      sample of MCI patients. Hence, the hypothesis that the adaptive training program 
      would lead to greater improvements compared to the non-adaptive training program was 
      not supported. Within group analyses was not performed due to the stringent RCT 
      design.

AB  - It has clearly been demonstrated that cognitive stimulation, physical exercise, and 
      social engagement help counteract age-related cognitive decline. However, several 
      important issues remain to be addressed. Given the wide differences in cognitive 
      impairment found among individuals of the same age, identifying the subjects who 
      will benefit most from late-life interventions is one such issue. Environmental 
      Enrichment (EE) is a particularly valuable approach to do this. In this study, aged 
      (21-month-old) rats were assigned to a better (BL) or a worse (WL) learner group 
      (training phase) and to a non-impaired (NI) or an impaired (I) group (probe phase) 
      by their performance on the Morris Water Maze, using the test performances of adult 
      (12-month-old) rats as the cut-offs. The aged rats were retested after a 12-week EE 
      or standard housing (SH) protocol. After 12 weeks, the performances of SH rats had 
      deteriorated, whereas all rats benefited from EE, albeit in different ways. In 
      particular, the animals assigned to the BL and the NI groups prior to EE still 
      performed as well as the adult rats (performance preservation) whereas, critically, 
      the animals assigned to the WL and the I groups before EE showed such improved 
      performances that they reached the level of the adult rats (performance 
      improvement), despite having aged further. EE seems to induce the preservation in 
      BLs and the improvement in WLs of spatial search strategies and the preservation in 
      NIs and the increase in Is of a focused and protract research of the escape point. 
      Our findings suggest that late-life EE prevents spatial learning and memory decline 
      in still cognitively preserved animals and stimulates residual functional reserve in 
      already cognitively compromised animals. Future research should focus on 
      individually tailored stimulation protocols to improve their effect and afford a 
      better understanding of the underlying processes.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) deaths have increased by 89% since 2000. This alarming 
      trajectory of neurological disease highlights the failure of current best practice. 
      Deteriorating brain fuel supply is the nemesis of intact neurological health. 
      Cerebral hypo-metabolism associated with AD occurs years before onset. Both the 
      ketogenic diet and calorie restriction (fasting) lead to a compensatory rise in 
      ketones to improve energy deficits in the brain derived from cerebral insulin 
      resistance. Two forms of ketone bodies, β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, fuel the 
      brain during starvation, fasting and strenuous exercise. Ketones are neuroprotective 
      agents that shelter the aging brain from memory loss and neurodegeneration. Induced 
      ketone production has been shown to ameliorate mitochondrial function, reduce the 
      expression of apoptotic and inflammatory mediators and provide neuroprotection to 
      cells (Lange et al., 2017). This case study highlights an innovative research design 
      aimed at attenuating memory decline in a 57 year old female previously diagnosed 
      with comorbid mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and metabolic syndrome (MetS). Mild 
      cognitive impairment is a predementia syndrome known to precede AD (Michaud et al, 
      2017). The 12-week intervention included ketogenic nutrition protocol, high 
      intensity interval training (HIIT) and memory training using the PEAK brain training 
      app. Memory function was assessed via the MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) 
      pre/post intervention. Physiological biomarkers for MetS including 
      HOMA-IR(homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance), triglyceride/HDL ratio, 
      HgA1c, fasting triglycerides and HDL were measured pre/post intervention. MoCA 
      baseline score was 22/30 (MCI); post intervention score: 30/30 (normal). MetS 
      biomarker improvements also reflected statistical significance.

AB  - Singapore has an ageing population with a projected 53,000 people aged ≥ 60 years 
      living with dementia by 2020. Primary care doctors have the opportunity to initiate 
      early work-up for reversible causes of cognitive dysfunction, allowing 
      identification of comorbidities and discussion of medical therapy options. Early 
      diagnosis confers the sick role on the patient, which allays frustration and 
      explains events and behaviour that may have strained relationships with family and 
      friends. The patient can be encouraged to plan for future health and personal care 
      options with a Lasting Power of Attorney and/or Advance Care Planning. Objective 
      cognitive tests (e.g. abbreviated mental test and Mini-Mental State Examination) and 
      brain imaging are adjuncts that help in formulating the diagnosis. Referral to a 
      hospital memory clinic activates a multidisciplinary team approach to dementia, 
      including clinical consultation, dementia counselling, physiotherapy sessions on 
      gait/fall prevention, occupational therapy sessions on cognitive stimulation and 
      caregiver training.

AB  - Studies suggest that the engagement of aged participants in cognitive stimulation 
      programs can reduce expected cognitive decline associated with age. OBJECTIVE: To 
      evaluate the effects of memory training (MT) associated with three-dimensional 
      multiple object tracking (3D-MOT) NeuroTracker (NT) in the elderly. METHODS: 
      Forty-four participants (>60 years of age) were recruited and randomly distributed 
      into two groups: experimental (EG; n=22) and comparative (CG; n=22). Both groups 
      performed 12 one-hour MT sessions, twice a week, consisting of specific computerized 
      stimuli associated with teaching of mnemonic strategies; 10 minutes of NT was part 
      only of the EG's sessions. In pre- and post-training periods, both groups were 
      evaluated using a sociodemographic questionnaire, neuropsychological assessment, as 
      well as a specific measure offered by NT. RESULTS: Both groups benefited from the MT 
      and reported more positive feelings regarding their memory and quality of life. 
      However, the EG obtained better results in tests consistent with the strategies 
      trained and which involved attentional resources, reaction time, visual processing 
      speed, episodic, semantic, subjective and working memory as well as aspects of 
      social cognition. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the combination of MT and 
      3D-MOT contributed for a better cognitive performance in the EG. Thus, the results 
      of the present study encourage further research and the development of combined 
      cognitive interventions for the elderly population with and without cognitive 
      deficits.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is evidence to suggest that cognitive stimulation produces 
      cognitive benefits in people with mild neurocognitive disorder. However, the effect 
      has been previously demonstrated to be minimal to moderate and the effect of 
      long-term individual interventions, namely on specific cognitive domains, is 
      unknown. AIM: To assess the efficacy, feasibility and acceptability of a long-term 
      individual cognitive stimulation intervention for patients with mild neurocognitive 
      disorder. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 30) with mild neurocognitive disorder 
      were assigned to a cognitive stimulation intervention group (n = 15) or to a control 
      group (n = 15). The intervention consisted of 88 individual sessions, approximately 
      45 minutes long, with two sessions per week. External evaluators assessed the level 
      of alteration in cognitive performance, depressive symptoms and the level of 
      independence in the performance of basic activities of daily living. RESULTS: After 
      the intervention, a significant improvement was found in the intervention group 
      compared to the control group in overall cognitive performance (d = 0.83), 
      specifically in the language domain (d until 1.50). There were also lower depressive 
      symptoms in the intervention group compared to the control group (d = 0.93). Only 
      6.7% of the participants dropped out the study, with participants attending a mean 
      of 83 ± 12.1 sessions. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the efficacy, feasibility 
      and acceptability of the intervention for mild neurocognitive disorder and justify a 
      randomized controlled trial of the program with a larger sample.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility and evaluate effects of a computerized 
      working memory (WM) training (WMT) in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) on 
      cognitive and clinical outcomes. METHODS: 76 patients with PD without cognitive 
      impairment were randomized to either the WMT group (n = 37), who participated in a 
      5-week adaptive WMT, or a passive waiting-list control group (CG, n = 39). Patients 
      underwent clinical and neuropsychological examination at baseline, after training, 
      and at 3-months follow-up, with verbal WM and non-verbal WM as primary outcomes. 
      Outcome assessors were blinded for group allocation. RESULTS: All WMT participants 
      completed the training successfully and reported high levels of motivation for and 
      satisfaction with the training. Repeated-measures, linear mixed-effects models 
      revealed positive training effects for the WMT group compared to the CG in verbal 
      working memory with a small relative effect size 0.39 [95%CI 0.05; 0.76] for the 
      3-months follow-up only. No other reliable training effects in cognitive and 
      clinical variables were found for either point of time. CONCLUSIONS: In this 
      randomized controlled trial, WMT was feasible and yielded some evidence for 3-months 
      follow-up training gains in patients with PD. WMT might be an effective intervention 
      to prevent cognitive decline in this patient group, however, more longitudinal 
      studies with longer follow-up periods and more sensitive assessment tools will have 
      to proof this concept. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trials Register

AB  - Background & Objectives: This pilot study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of memory 
      training and health training intervention over a 24-month period in people with 
      probable mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Research Design & Methods: Based on the 
      accepted criteria, and the neuropsychiatric measures used in the trial, MCI was 
      defined as a subjective change in cognition, impairment in episodic memory, 
      preservation of independence of functional abilities, and no dementia. Without a 
      neurological assessment, laboratory tests, and psychometric evaluation combined, 
      some of our participants may have had dementia that we were unable to detect through 
      neuropsychological testing. Of the 263 total participants, 39 met criteria for a 
      diagnosis of MCI. There were 19 adults in the memory and 20 in health training 
      conditions. Both groups received twenty hours of classroom content that included 
      eight hours of booster sessions at three months post intervention. Hierarchical 
      linear models (HLM) and standardized regression-based (SBR) analyses were used to 
      test the efficacy of the intervention on immediate recall, delayed recall, 
      subjective memory complaints, and memory self-efficacy. Age, education, depression, 
      racial group, ethnic group, MMSE score, and baseline performance were included as 
      covariates. Results: Over 24 months, the MCI group in the memory training condition 
      showed better objective and subjective memory outcomes compared with the MCI group 
      in the health training condition. Conclusions: Senior WISE Memory training delivered 
      to individuals with MCI was able to forestall the participants' declining cognitive 
      ability and sustain the benefit over two years in both subjective and objective 
      memory function.

TI  - Brain activity pattern changes after adaptive working memory training in multiple 
      sclerosis.
PG  - 142-154
LID - 10.1007/s11682-018-9984-z [doi]
AB  - Cognitive impairment and related abnormal brain activity are common in people with 
      multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Adaptive training based on working memory (WM) has been 
      shown to ameliorate cognitive symptoms, although the effects at a neural level are 
      unclear. The aim of this study was to expand the existing research on the effects of 
      an adaptive WM rehabilitative intervention on brain functional activity in PwMS. A 
      sample of eighteen PwMS performed an 8-week home-based cognitive rehabilitation 
      treatment based on adaptive WM training. PwMS were assessed before and after 
      treatment using a validated neuropsychological battery and undergoing an fMRI 
      session while carrying out a cognitive task (i.e., Paced Visual Serial Addition Test 
      - PVSAT). fMRI activations were compared to the activation pattern elicited by 
      eighteen matched healthy subjects performing the same task. At baseline, we found 
      abnormal brain activity during PVSAT in PwMS when compared to healthy subjects, with 
      a pattern including several bilateral activation clusters. Following rehabilitation, 
      PwMS improved cognitive performance, as evaluated by the neuropsychological battery, 
      and showed a different activation map with clusters mainly located in the right 
      cerebellum and in the left hemisphere. The only significant cluster in the right 
      hemisphere was located in the inferior parietal lobule, and the BOLD signal 
      extracted in this area significantly correlated with cognitive performance both 
      before and after the treatment. We suggest that WM training can improve the 
      cognitive performance and reduce the abnormal activation of PwMS by partially 
      maintaining or even restoring brain cognitive function.

AB  - The scope of this article is to identify the repercussions of the effect of memory 
      stimulation in healthy elderly individuals. It is an integrative review of the 
      literature, namely of articles published in the last seven years in English, 
      Portuguese and Spanish. The selection was performed through cross-checking of key 
      words: health of the elderly, memory and cognition in the Lilacs, Medline and IBECS 
      databases. The inclusion criteria were: original article; addressing key issue; full 
      text electronically available; population 60 years and above without diagnosis of 
      cognitive impairment. Twelve articles were selected and it was identified that the 
      effect of memory stimulation in the elderly without cognitive impairment can improve 
      performance in advanced, instrumental and basic activities of daily living and in 
      psychological, social and quality of life components in the elderly. Based on 
      analysis of the articles it is important to emphasize the need for further 
      longitudinal and intervention studies focused on cognitive stimulation in the 
      elderly without cognitive impairment and that future research can overcome such 
      limitations by working towards efficient monitoring and evaluation, which is more 
      rigorous and committed to facilitate the cognitive performance of the elderly in 
      daily activities.

LID - 10.1017/S1355617718000619 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Subjective memory complaints (SMC) in older adults are associated with a 
      decline in everyday functioning and an increased risk for future cognitive decline. 
      This study examines the effect of a memory strategy training compared to a control 
      memory training on memory functioning in daily life. METHODS: This was a randomized 
      controlled trial with baseline, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up assessments 
      conducted in 60 older adults (50-87 years) with SMC. Participants were randomly 
      assigned to either seven sessions of memory strategy training or seven sessions of 
      control memory training. Both interventions were given in small groups and included 
      psycho-education. Primary outcome measure was memory functioning in daily life. 
      Objective measures of memory performance and self-reported measures of strategy use 
      were included as secondary outcome measures. RESULTS: Participants in each 
      intervention group reported an improvement in personal memory goals (p<.0005), up to 
      6 months after training. An interaction effect showed that participants following 
      memory strategy training reported a larger improvement in personal memory goals 
      (p=.002). Both intervention groups improved on two memory tests (p<.001 and p<.01). 
      In the memory strategy training group, an increase in strategy use in daily life was 
      the strongest predictor (p<.05) of improvement in subjective memory functioning. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Older adults with subjective memory complaints benefit from memory 
      strategy training, especially in their memory functioning in daily life. (JINS, 
      2018, 24, 1110-1120).

AB  - Dementias, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in particular, will increasingly become a 
      public health issue. However, three major data may change the severity of these 
      pathologies: in young adults, simple measures of healthy lifestyle (control of 
      vascular risk factors, physical activity and cognitive stimulation), have an impact 
      on a future cognitive decline; the same lifestyle interventions may delay the start 
      of the disease for elderly people potentially at-risk; finally, and for the first 
      time, a monoclonal antibody directed against amyloid lesions has just shown a 
      significant effect on the progression of AD in patients at an early stage of the 
      disease. According to these results, we will have to reconsider the strategy for 
      managing minor or severe cognitive disorders and particularly AD. Nowadays, patients 
      start the care process too late. The solution is to act earlier, even preventively. 
      It is necessary to improve a care offer adapted to this new situation in order to 
      impact on the disease as soon as possible, even before the onset of symptoms, based 
      on: 1) predictive algorithms aimed at establishing whose cognitively unimpaired 
      individuals may further develop the disease; these algorithms will be based on 
      demographic, family, cognitive, genomic and biological data, such as in the "Santé 
      Cerveau" project developed in partnership with the Health Regional Agency (ARS) and 
      the general practitioners; 2)and on some expert centers which must become "dementia 
      prevention clinics" to test prevention measures, initiate and validate multi-domain 
      therapeutic education programs; to disclose about the risk in response to the 
      request of worried patients; and to propose early pharmacological treatments if 
      these individuals are on the way to declare AD in the coming months, taking into 
      account competition between risks. This will allow to prepare to make use of new 
      pharmacological treatments that might be discovered.

TI  - Evaluating a frontostriatal working-memory updating-training paradigm in Parkinson's 
      disease: the iPARK trial, a double-blinded randomized controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive decline and dementia are common in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
      Cognitive deficits have been linked to the depletion of dopamine in the 
      nigrostriatal pathway, but pharmacological treatments for PD have little evidence of 
      improving or delaying cognitive decline. Therefore, exploring non-pharmacological 
      treatment options is important. There have been some promising results of cognitive 
      training interventions in PD, especially for improvements in working memory and 
      executive functions. Yet, existing studies are often underpowered, lacking 
      appropriate control condition, long term follow-up, a thorough description of the 
      intervention and characteristics of the participants. Working memory updating 
      training has previously shown to increase striatal activation in healthy young and 
      old participants as well as dopaminergic neurotransmission in healthy young 
      participants. In the light of dopamine dysfunction in PD, with negative effects on 
      both motor and cognitive functions it is of interest to study if an impaired 
      striatal system can be responsive to a non-invasive, non-pharmacological 
      intervention. METHODS AND DESIGN: The iPARK trial is a double-blinded, randomized 
      controlled trial with a parallel-group design that aims to recruit 80 patients with 
      PD (during the period 02/2017-02/2023). Included patients need to have PD, Hoehn and 
      Yahr staging I-III, be between 45 to 75 years of age and not have a diagnosis of 
      dementia. All patients will undergo 30 sessions (6-8 weeks) of web-based cognitive 
      training performed from home. The target intervention is a process-based training 
      program targeting working memory updating. The placebo program is a low dose 
      short-term memory program. A battery of neuropsychological tests and questionnaires 
      will be performed before training, directly after training, and 16 weeks after 
      training. DISCUSSION: We expect that the iPARK trial will provide novel and 
      clinically useful information on whether updating training is an effective cognitive 
      training paradigm in PD. Further, it will hopefully contribute to a better 
      understanding of cognitive function in PD and provide answers regarding cognitive 
      plasticity as well as determining critical factors for a responsive striatal system. 
      TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov registry number: NCT03680170 , registry name: 
      "Cognitive Training in Parkinson's Disease: the iPARK study", retrospectively 
      registered on the 21st of September 2018. The inclusion of the first participant was 
      the 1st of February 2017.

AB  - Strategies for memory enhancement, especially for the older population, are of great 
      scientific and public interest. Here, we aimed at investigating neuronal and 
      behavioral effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) paired with 
      memory training. Young and older adults were trained on an object-location-memory 
      task on 3 consecutive days with either anodal or sham tDCS. Recall performance was 
      assessed immediately after training, 1 day and 1 month later, as well as performance 
      on trained function and transfer task. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging was conducted at baseline and at 1-day follow-up to analyze functional 
      coupling in the default mode network. Anodal tDCS led to superior recall performance 
      after training, an associated increase in default mode network strength and enhanced 
      trained function and transfer after 1 month. Our findings suggest that 
      tDCS-accompanied multi-day training improves performance on trained material, is 
      associated with beneficial memory network alterations, and transfers to other memory 
      tasks. Our study provides insight into tDCS-induced behavioral and neuronal 
      alterations and will help to develop interventions against age-related cognitive 
      decline.

AB  - According to the WHO, by 2025 Brazil will be ranked sixth in the world in terms of 
      proportion of elderly in the population. Within this scope, cognition plays a 
      central role in the aging process, having an important association with quality of 
      life, which suggests the need to develop intervention programs, such as cognitive 
      training. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of a program of cognitive stimulation 
      workshops on the self-esteem and cognition of elderly people. METHODS: Thirty-eight 
      elderly subjects completed the three-step protocol: 1) Survey of demographic data 
      and evaluation of cognition by a neuropsychological battery and of self-esteem using 
      the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSS), prior to training; 2) Participation in twelve 
      cognitive stimulation workshops; and 3) Cognitive evaluation and RSS after the 
      training. RESULTS: Results showed that the use of training produced positive effects 
      on cognitive test performance of the elderly with and without cognitive impairment. 
      By extension, this demonstrates positive impact on their self-esteem. CONCLUSION: 
      These findings encourage investment in cognitive stimulation programs as a resource 
      for improved cognition and quality of life for the elderly. Subjective cognitive 
      complaint may have served as a predictor of decreased self-esteem; therefore, as 
      training improved cognition, it also improved self-esteem.

TI  - Is Computerized Working Memory Training Effective in Healthy Older Adults? Evidence 
      from a Multi-Site, Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 931-949
LID - 10.3233/JAD-180455 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Developing effective interventions to attenuate age-related cognitive 
      decline and prevent or delay the onset of dementia are major public health goals. 
      Computerized cognitive training (CCT) has been marketed increasingly to older 
      adults, but its efficacy remains unclear. Working memory (WM), a key determinant of 
      higher order cognitive abilities, is susceptible to age-related decline and a 
      relevant target for CCT in elders. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of CCT 
      focused on WM compared to an active control condition in healthy older adults. 
      METHODS: Eighty-two cognitively normal adults from two sites (USA and Sweden) were 
      randomly assigned to Cogmed Adaptive or Non-Adaptive (active control) CCT groups. 
      Training was performed in participants' homes, five days per week over five weeks. 
      Changes in the performance of the Cogmed trained tasks, and in five 
      neuropsychological tests (Trail Making Test Part A and Part B, Digit Symbol, 
      Controlled Oral Word Association Test and Semantic Fluency) were used as outcome 
      measures. RESULTS: The groups were comparable at baseline. The Adaptive group showed 
      robust gains in the trained tasks, and there was a time-by-group interaction for the 
      Digit Symbol test, with significant improvement only after Adaptive training. In 
      addition, the magnitude of the intervention effect was similar at both sites. 
      CONCLUSION: Home-based CCT Adaptive WM training appears more effective than 
      Non-Adaptive training in older adults from different cultural backgrounds. We 
      present evidence of improvement in trained tasks and on a demanding untrained task 
      dependent upon WM and processing speed. The benefits over the active control group 
      suggest that the Adaptive CCT gains were linked to providing a continuously 
      challenging level of WM difficulty.

PG  - 199-212
LID - 10.1177/1545968319832605 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Paired exercise and cognitive training have the potential to enhance 
      cognition by "priming" the brain and upregulating neurotrophins. METHODS: Two-site 
      randomized controlled trial. Fifty-two patients >6 months poststroke with concerns 
      about cognitive impairment trained 50 to 70 minutes, 3× week for 10 weeks with 
      12-week follow-up. Participants were randomized to 1 of 2 physical interventions: 
      Aerobic (>60% VO(2peak) using <10% body weight-supported treadmill) or Activity 
      (range of movement and functional tasks). Exercise was paired with 1 of 2 cognitive 
      interventions (computerized dual working memory training [COG] or control computer 
      games [Games]). The primary outcome for the 4 groups (Aerobic + COG, Aerobic + 
      Games, Activity + COG, and Activity + Games) was fluid intelligence measured using 
      Raven's Progressive Matrices Test administered at baseline, posttraining, and 
      3-month follow-up. Serum neurotrophins collected at one site (N = 30) included 
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) at rest (BDNF(resting)) and after a graded 
      exercise test (BDNF(response)) and insulin-like growth factor-1 at the same 
      timepoints (IGF-1(rest), IGF-1(response)). RESULTS: At follow-up, fluid intelligence 
      scores significantly improved compared to baseline in the Aerobic + COG and Activity 
      + COG groups; however, only the Aerobic + COG group was significantly different 
      (+47.8%) from control (Activity + Games -8.5%). Greater IGF-1(response) at baseline 
      predicted 40% of the variance in cognitive improvement. There was no effect of the 
      interventions on BDNF(resting) or BDNF(response); nor was BDNF predictive of the 
      outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic exercise combined with cognitive training improved 
      fluid intelligence by almost 50% in patients >6 months poststroke. Participants with 
      more robust improvements in cognition were able to upregulate higher levels of serum 
      IGF-1 suggesting that this neurotrophin may be involved in behaviorally induced 
      plasticity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy and safety of combined transcranial direct 
      current stimulation (tDCS) and working memory training (WMT) in enhancing the 
      cognitive functions for individuals with mild neurocognitive disorder due to AD 
      (NCD-AD). METHODS: In this double-blind, sham-controlled randomized clinical trial 
      (RCT), 201 patients with NCD-AD were randomly assigned for a 4-week intervention of 
      either a combination of tDCS and WMT, sham tDCS and WMT, or tDCS and control 
      cognitive training (CCT). Global cognition and domain-specific cognitive function 
      were assessed before and after the intervention with Alzheimer's disease assessment 
      scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), category verbal fluency test, logical memory, 
      digit, and visual span tests. RESULTS: Study participants did not show intervention 
      group differences in baseline demographics, or cognitive characteristics (ANOVA). 
      Cognitive enhancement was found across three groups after 4 weeks intervention. 
      Combined tDCS-WMT group showed significantly greater improvement compared with 
      single-modality groups in delayed recall (P = 0.043, η(2)  = 0.036) and working 
      memory capacity (P = 0.04, η(2)  = 0.038) at 4th week, and logical memory at 12th 
      week (P = 0.042, η(2)  = 0.037). Adverse events, including skin lesions (2.2%), were 
      similar between groups. INTERPRETATION: tDCS or WMT could be a safe, feasible, and 
      effective intervention for individuals with NCD-AD. A combination of tDCS and WMT 
      presents greater cognitive enhancement, which may highlight the potential 
      synergistic effects of combined modality intervention on cognition.

AB  - As the demographic structure in western societies ages, the prevalence and impact of 
      cognitive decline rises. Thus, new solutions to tackle this problem are required. 
      The use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)-based cognitive 
      exercises has emerged in the last few decades, though with inconsistent results. 
      Hence, we conducted a pre-post treatment study to further investigate this approach. 
      We designed a set of virtual reality exercises that mimic activities of daily living 
      by which the patient can train different cognitive domains. Twenty-five 
      participants, ages 65-85, underwent 12 training sessions between the pre-treatment 
      and post-treatment assessments. Significant increases were seen between the two 
      assessments for some of the neuropsychological measures: visual memory, attention, 
      and cognitive flexibility. Results also suggest that participants with lower 
      baseline cognitive performance levels improved most after these sessions.

AB  - Interventions for age-associated cognitive impairment are of increasing significance 
      as populations age. Using N-back and memory strategy enhancement, the present study 
      aimed to explore the feasibility of using, and outcomes of a working memory (WM) 
      training program on visuospatial and verbal WM in older female adults. Older women 
      from two comparable local health centers who scored 26 and higher on Mini-Mental 
      State Examination were invited to participate. Women at one center (experimental 
      group) received three sessions on memory enhancement techniques and a computerized 
      training program with N-back. Women at the other center (control group) received 
      three sessions on memory and aging and training on using various features of 
      cellphones. All participants completed the Corsi Block Task and Digit Span Task at 
      pre- and post-training. The experimental group showed significant improvements in 
      their visuospatial and verbal WM compared to the control group. These findings 
      support the brain's plasticity in the elderly. WM training for improving cognitive 
      performance in older adults has potential and should be further investigated.

TI  - MEMO+: Efficacy, Durability and Effect of Cognitive Training and Psychosocial 
      Intervention in Individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment.
PG  - 655-663
LID - 10.1111/jgs.15192 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: There is no consensus on the efficacy of cognitive training 
      in persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) because of the paucity of 
      well-designed randomized controlled trials. The objective was to assess the effect 
      of memory training on the cognitive functioning of persons with MCI and its 
      durability and to evaluate whether this effect generalizes to daily life and whether 
      positive effects could be obtained from psychosocial intervention. DESIGN: 
      Single-blind randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Research centers of the Institut 
      Universitaire de Gériatrie de Montréal and Institut Universitaire en Santé Mentale 
      de Québec. PARTICIPANTS: Older adults meeting criteria for amnestic MCI (N = 145). 
      INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized to cognitive training, a psychosocial 
      intervention, or a no-contact control condition. Interventions were provided in 
      small groups in eight 2-hour sessions. MEASUREMENT: Outcome measures were immediate 
      and delayed composite performance memory scores, psychological health (depression, 
      anxiety, well-being), and generalization effects of the intervention (strategy use 
      in everyday life, difficulties in complex activities of daily living, memory 
      complaints). Testing was administered before training and immediately, 3 months, and 
      6 months after training. RESULTS: Participants in the cognitive training condition 
      improved on the delayed composite memory score and on strategy use in everyday life. 
      Improvement was maintained at the 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments. Participants 
      in the psychosocial and no-contact conditions did not show any significant 
      improvement. CONCLUSION: Cognitive training improves the memory of persons with 
      amnestic MCI. The effect persists over a 6-month period, and learned strategies are 
      used in everyday life. Cognitive training is a valid way to promote cognition in 
      MCI.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease associated with progressive 
      memory and cognitive decline. Previous studies have identified the benefits of 
      cognitive enrichment on reducing disease pathology. Additionally, epidemiological 
      and clinical data suggest that repeated exercise, and cognitive and social 
      enrichment, can improve and/or delay the cognitive deficiencies associated with 
      aging and neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study, 3xTg-AD mice were 
      exposed to a rigorous training routine beginning at 3 months of age, which consisted 
      of repeated training in the Morris water maze spatial recognition task every 3 
      months, ending at 18 months of age. At the conclusion of the final Morris water maze 
      training session, animals subsequently underwent testing in another 
      hippocampus-dependent spatial task, the Barnes maze task, and on the more 
      cortical-dependent novel object recognition memory task. Our data show that periodic 
      cognitive enrichment throughout aging, via multiple learning episodes in the Morris 
      water maze task, can improve the memory performance of aged 3xTg-AD mice in a 
      separate spatial recognition task, and in a preference memory task, when compared to 
      naïve aged matched 3xTg-AD mice. Furthermore, we observed that the cognitive 
      enrichment properties of Morris water maze exposer, was detectable in repeatedly 
      trained animals as early as 6 months of age. These findings suggest early repeated 
      cognitive enrichment can mitigate the diverse cognitive deficits observed in 
      Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - Investigating the Effects of Spacing on Working Memory Training Outcome: A 
      Randomized, Controlled, Multisite Trial in Older Adults.
PG  - 1181-1192
LID - 10.1093/geronb/gbz090 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The majority of the population will experience some cognitive decline 
      with age. Therefore, the development of effective interventions to mitigate 
      age-related decline is critical for older adults' cognitive functioning and their 
      quality of life. METHODS: In our randomized controlled multisite trial, we target 
      participants' working memory (WM) skills, and in addition, we focus on the 
      intervention's optimal scheduling in order to test whether and how the distribution 
      of training sessions might affect task learning, and ultimately, transfer. Healthy 
      older adults completed an intervention targeting either WM or general knowledge 
      twice per day, once per day, or once every-other-day. Before and after the 
      intervention and 3 months after training completion, participants were tested in a 
      variety of cognitive domains, including those representing functioning in everyday 
      life. RESULTS: In contrast to our hypotheses, spacing seems to affect learning only 
      minimally. We did observe some transfer effects, especially within the targeted 
      cognitive domain (WM and inhibition/interference), which remained stable at the 
      3-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: Our findings have practical implications by showing 
      that the variation in training schedule, at least within the range used here, does 
      not seem to be a crucial element for training benefits.

TI  - Development and effectiveness of virtual interactive working memory training for 
      older people with mild cognitive impairment: a single-blind randomised controlled 
      trial.
PG  - 519-525
LID - 10.1093/ageing/afz029 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: memory training is a potential intervention for retaining memory and 
      reducing dementia risk in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). 
      OBJECTIVE: this study examined the effect of virtual interactive working memory 
      training (VIMT) in older adults with MCI. DESIGN: single-blind, two-arm 
      parallel-group, randomised controlled design. SETTING: retirement homes, 
      institutions, and communities. SUBJECTS: a total of 66 older adults with MCI were 
      recruited (mean age: 78.5 ± 7.6 years). METHODS: participants were randomly assigned 
      to the experimental group (VIMT, n = 33) or active control group (n = 33). The VIMT 
      program used the CogniPlus (includes four training modules). Both groups attended 45 
      min sessions 3 times per week, a total of 36 sessions. The primary outcome was 
      working memory; secondary outcomes were immediate memory, delayed memory, subjective 
      memory complaints and global cognitive function. All variables were measured at 
      pre-test, post-test, and 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: between group, the effect of 
      working memory adjusted mean difference by 1.75 (95% CI: 0.56 to 2.94; P < 0.01) at 
      post-test. The results were analysed by a generalised estimating equation, which 
      indicated that VIMT group significantly improved working memory at post-test (P = 
      0.01) relative to the active control group. CONCLUSIONS: the applied VIMT program 
      can enable older adults with MCI to maintain their working memory and reduce the 
      rate of cognitive deterioration. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered on 
      ClinicalTrials.gov (no.: NCT02462135).

TI  - Impact of 3-Day Combined Anodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation-Visuospatial 
      Training on Object-Location Memory in Healthy Older Adults and Patients with Mild 
      Cognitive Impairment.
PG  - 223-244
LID - 10.3233/JAD-191234 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Associative object-location memory (OLM) is known to decline even in 
      normal aging, and this process is accelerated in patients with mild cognitive 
      impairment (MCI). Given the lack of curative treatment for Alzheimer's disease, 
      activating cognitive resources during its preclinical phase might prevent 
      progression to dementia. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of anodal transcranial 
      direct current stimulation (atDCS) combined with an associative episodic memory 
      training on OLM in MCI patients and in healthy elderly (HE). METHODS: In a 
      single-blind cross-over design, 16 MCI patients and 32 HE underwent a 3-day 
      visuospatial OLM training paired with either 20 min or 30 s (sham) atDCS (1 mA, 
      right temporoparietal cortex). Effects on immediate (training success) and long-term 
      memory (1-month) were investigated by conducting Mixed Model analyses. In addition, 
      the impact of combined intervention on within-session (online) and on 
      between-session (offline) performance were explored. RESULTS: OLM training+atDCS 
      enhanced training success only in MCI patients, but not HE (difference n.s.). 
      Relative performance gain was similar in MCI patients compared to HE under atDCS. No 
      beneficial effect was found after 1-month. Exploratory analyses suggested a positive 
      impact on online, but a negative effect on offline performance in MCI patients. In 
      both groups, exploratory post-hoc analyses indicated an association between 
      initially low-performers and greater benefit from atDCS. CONCLUSION: Cognitive 
      training in MCI may be enhanced by atDCS, but further delineation of the impact of 
      current brain state, as well as temporal characteristics of multi-session 
      atDCS-training application, may be needed to induce longer-lasting effects.

LID - 5713934
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cognitive impairment (CI) affects 40-65% of patients with multiple 
      sclerosis (MS). Few studies address telematic cognitive stimulation (TCS) in MS. The 
      objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and impact of telestimulation or 
      distance cognitive stimulation (TCS), with and without the support of face-to-face 
      cognitive stimulation (FCS) in cognitive impairment in MS. METHODS: Multicentre, 
      prospective, randomised, controlled study. We will include 98 MS patients with 
      EDSS ≤ 6, symbol digit modality test (SDMT) ≤ Pc 25, and Multiple Sclerosis 
      Neuropsychological Screening Questionnaire (MSNQ) > 26 points. Patients will be 
      randomised into 3 groups, a TCS group, a mixed TCS/FCS group, and a control group. 
      CS is performed 3 days a week for 3 months. Processing speed, memory, attention, and 
      executive functions will be rehabilitated. FCS will include ecological exercises and 
      strategies. EDSS and a cognitive evaluation (SDMT, CTMT, PASAT, and TAVEC), MSNQ, 
      psychological impact scales (MSIS), and depression (BDI) will be carried out, 
      baseline, postrehabilitation, and also 6 and 12 months later, to evaluate the effect 
      of CS in the longer term. CONCLUSION: This study could help to establish the 
      usefulness of TCS or, in its absence, TCS with face-to-face help for CI in MS. The 
      interest lies in the clear benefits of remote rehabilitation in the daily life of 
      patients.

AB  - The cognitive impairment characterizing the phenotype of older adults has been 
      related to the efficiency of the antioxidant system. This study aimed at 
      investigating the effect of memory training (MT) on memory, global cognitive 
      functioning, and the oxidant and antioxidant capacity of plasma. We recruited 52 
      healthy subjects aged over 60. Twenty-nine subjects were submitted to 6-months of MT 
      (Experimental Group, EG), and 23 were used as a Control Group (CG). Global cognitive 
      functioning was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Short- and 
      Long-Term Memory (STM and LTM, respectively) by the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning 
      Test (RAVLT) at baseline (T0) and after 6-months (T1). Meanwhile, Reactive Oxygen 
      Metabolites derivative compounds (d-ROMs), Biological Antioxidant Potential (BAP), 
      and their ratio were evaluated on plasma. Results showed that the MMSE and RAVLT 
      scores improved in EG at T1. At the same time, the d-ROMs levels significantly 
      decreased, while the BAP and BAP/d-ROMs ratio showed an opposite trend. In both 
      groups, the MMSE and LTM scores were negatively associated with d-ROMs levels, and 
      positively correlated with BAP levels and the BAP/d-ROMs ratio. When we considered 
      the Δvalue (Δvariable = variable post-MT minus variable pre-MT) in EG, the ΔMMSE and 
      ΔLTM scores were negatively associated to Δd-ROMs, and positively to ΔBAP and 
      ΔBAP/dROM. In conclusion, our results suggest that MT improves memory and global 
      cognitive functioning. These processes were significantly associated to increase in 
      resistance against oxidative stress at the plasma level in healthy older adults.

TI  - Is Blood Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor a Useful Biomarker to Monitor Mild 
      Cognitive Impairment Patients?
PG  - 411-419
LID - 10.1089/rej.2020.2307 [doi]
AB  - Availability of reliable prognostic biomarkers that are also able to monitor 
      preventive/therapeutic interventions in patients with mild cognitive impairment 
      (MCI) is crucial. Cerebral brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) alterations were 
      evidenced in Alzheimer's disease, but the value of blood BDNF in MCI is unclear, 
      especially because of the incomplete/incorrect management of the numerous 
      confounding factors unrelated to the disease. This study, applying a 
      multidisciplinary methodological approach, aimed at clarifying whether blood BDNF 
      can really mirror the cognitive symptoms of MCI, thus supporting the evaluation of 
      clinical protocols' effectiveness as well as the definition of the conversion rate 
      to dementia. Healthy elderly subjects (HE) and MCI patients were assessed for 
      sociodemographic, neuropsychological, pharmacological, and lifestyle data, and 
      plasma BDNF was measured (baseline); then, in the MCI cohort, the biomarker was 
      tested in a comprehensive cognitive stimulation intervention (CS) as well as in a 
      2-year follow-up period. Plasma BDNF, cleansed from all the interfering factors, (1) 
      did not discriminate HE and MCI patients; (2) in MCI patients reflected mood, social 
      engagement, and subjective memory complaints but not cognition; (3) changed due to 
      CS, although with no correlations to cognitive performances; and (4) predicted no 
      functional deterioration. Our data indicate that the possible biased use of plasma 
      BDNF in MCI is critically risky.

      Cognitive Impairment and Oxidative Stress in MCI Patients: A Pilot Study.

AB  - The growing elderly population and the increased incidence of mild cognitive 
      impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) call for the improvement of the 
      quality and the efficacy of the healthcare and social support services. Exercise and 
      cognitive stimulation have been demonstrated to mitigate cognitive impairment and 
      oxidative stress (OxS) has been recognized as a factor that contributes to the 
      advancement of neurodegenerative diseases. Taking these aspects into account, the 
      impact of a novel virtual reality (VR)-based program combining aerobic exercise and 
      cognitive training has been evaluated in the pilot study proposed here. Ten patients 
      (aged 73.3 ± 5.7 years) with MCI (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE: 23.0 ± 3.4) 
      were randomly assigned to either 6 weeks physical and cognitive training (EXP) or 
      control (CTR) group. Evaluations of cognitive profile, by a neuropsychological tests 
      battery, and OxS, by collection of blood and urine samples, were performed before 
      and at the end of the experimental period. The assessment of the patients' opinions 
      toward the intervention was investigated through questionnaires. EXP group showed a 
      tendency towards improvements in the MMSE, in visual-constructive test and 
      visuo-spatial tests of attention, while CTR worsened. EXP group showed a greater 
      improvement than CTR in the executive test, memory functions and verbal fluency. No 
      statistical significance was obtained when comparing within and between both the 
      groups, probably due to small number of subjects examined, which amplifies the 
      effect of the slight heterogeneity in scores recorded. Despite a greater worsening 
      of Daily Living Activities tests, all participants reported a better performance in 
      real life, thanks to the elicited self-perceived improvement. After training 
      intervention OxS (i.e., reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, oxidative damage 
      of lipids and DNA) decreased resulting in significantly (range p < 0.05-0.001) lower 
      in EXP vs. CTR group. Although not conclusive, the recorded effects in the present 
      study are promising and suggest that this proposal would be a useful tool in support 
      of cognitive training reducing OxS too. However, further studies on larger scale 
      samples of patients are needed.

AB  - Observed influences of system response delay in spoken human-machine dialogues are 
      rather ambiguous and mainly focus on perceived system quality. Studies that 
      systematically inspect effects on cognitive performance are still lacking, and 
      effects of individual characteristics are also often neglected. Building on benefits 
      of cognitive training for decelerating cognitive decline, this Wizard-of-Oz study 
      addresses both issues by testing 62 elderly participants in a dialogue-based memory 
      training with a virtual agent. Participants acquired the method of loci with fading 
      instructional guidance and applied it afterward to memorizing and recalling lists of 
      German nouns. System response delays were randomly assigned, and training 
      performance was included as potential mediator. Participants' age, gender, and 
      subscales of affinity for technology (enthusiasm, competence, positive and negative 
      perception of technology) were inspected as potential moderators. The results 
      indicated positive effects on recall performance with higher training performance, 
      female gender, and less negative perception of technology. Additionally, memory 
      retention and facets of affinity for technology moderated increasing system response 
      delays. Participants also provided higher ratings in perceived system quality with 
      higher enthusiasm for technology but reported increasing frustration with a more 
      positive perception of technology. Potential explanations and implications for the 
      design of spoken dialogue systems are discussed.

AB  - Cognitive training has been shown to result in improved behavioral performance in 
      normal aging and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), yet little is known about the 
      neural correlates of cognitive plasticity, or about individual differences in 
      responsiveness to cognitive training. In this study, 21 healthy older adults and 14 
      patients with MCI received five weeks of adaptive computerized working-memory (WM) 
      training. Before and after training, functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) 
      was used to assess the hemodynamic response in left and right prefrontal cortex 
      during performance of a verbal n-back task with varying levels of WM load. After 
      training, healthy older adults demonstrated decreased prefrontal activation at high 
      WM load, which may indicate increased processing efficiency. Although MCI patients 
      showed improved behavioral performance at low WM load after training, no evidence 
      was found for training-related changes in prefrontal activation. Whole-group 
      analyses showed that a relatively strong hemodynamic response at low WM load was 
      related to worse behavioral performance, while a relatively strong hemodynamic 
      response at high WM load was related to higher training gain. Therefore, a 
      'youth-like' prefrontal activation pattern at older age may be associated with 
      better behavioral outcome and cognitive plasticity.

AB  - Working memory is a cognitive process that is particularly vulnerable to decline 
      with age. The current study sought to evaluate the efficacy of a working memory 
      training scheme in improving memory in a group of older adults. A 5-week online 
      training scheme was designed to provide training in the main components of 
      Baddeley's (2000) working memory model, namely auditory and visuospatial short-term 
      and working memory. A group of older adults aged between 64 and 79 were randomly 
      assigned to a trainee (n = 19) or control (n = 17) group, with trainees engaging in 
      the adaptive training scheme and controls engaging in a non-adaptive version of the 
      program. Before and after training and at 3- and 6-month follow-up sessions, 
      trainees and controls were asked to complete measures of short-term and working 
      memory, long-term episodic memory, subjective ratings of memory, and attention and 
      achievement of goals set at the beginning of training. The results provided evidence 
      of an expansion of auditory short-term memory span, which was maintained 6 months 
      later, and transfer to long-term episodic memory but no evidence of improvement in 
      working memory capacity per se. A serendipitous and intriguing finding of a 
      relationship between time spent training, psychological stress, and training gains 
      provided further insight into individual differences in training gains in older 
      adults.

TI  - A longitudinal study of computerized cognitive training in stroke patients - effects 
      on cognitive function and white matter.
PG  - 241-247
LID - 10.1080/10749357.2018.1443570 [doi]
AB  - Background Computerized cognitive training is suggested to enhance attention and 
      working memory functioning following stroke, but effects on brain and behavior are 
      not sufficiently studied and longitudinal studies assessing brain and behavior 
      relationships are scarce. Objective The study objectives were to investigate 
      relations between neuropsychological performance post-stroke and white matter 
      microstructure measures derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), including 
      changes after 6 weeks of working memory training. Methods In this experimental 
      training study, 26 stroke patients underwent DTI and neuropsychological tests at 3 
      time points - before and after a passive phase of 6 weeks, and again after 6 weeks 
      of working memory training (Cogmed QM). Fractional anisotropy (FA) was extracted 
      from stroke-free brain areas to assess the white matter microstructure. Twenty-two 
      participants completed the majority of training (≥18/25 sessions) and were entered 
      into longitudinal analyses. Results Significant correlations between FA and baseline 
      cognitive functions were observed (r = 0.58, p = 0.004), however, no evidence was 
      found of generally improved cognitive functions following training or of changes in 
      white matter microstructure. Conclusions While white matter microstructure related 
      to baseline cognitive function in stroke patients, the study revealed no effect on 
      cognitive functions or microstructural changes in white matter in relation to 
      computerized working memory training.

AB  - Aging cognitive decline has been associated to impairment of the Hypothalamus 
      Pituitary Adrenals (HPA) axis activity and a higher level of the systemic 
      inflammation. However, little is known about the molecules driving this process at 
      peripheral level. In addition, the cognitive function is to some extent modifiable 
      with Memory Training (MT) programs, even among older adults and beyond. The study 
      aims to evaluate whether MT could contribute to ameliorate cognitive performance and 
      modulate the HPA axis activity as well the low level inflammation in the aging 
      phenotype. Whether the phosphatase WIP-1, a negative regulator for inflammation, is 
      involved in this process was also investigated. We recruited 31 young adults (19-28, 
      years of age) and 62 older adults aged over 60. Thirty-two older adults were 
      submitted to 6-months of MT program (EG), and 28 older adults were no treated and 
      used as Control Group (CG). Global cognitive functioning (MMSE score), verbal and 
      visual memory, and attention were assessed at baseline (T0) and after 6-months (T1). 
      At the same time, plasmatic level of Cortisol (C), IL-1β, IL-18, IL-6, and the 
      expression of WIP-1 mRNA and protein in ex vivo Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells 
      were analyzed in young adults at T0, as well in older adults at T0 and T1. Together, 
      the results suggest that MT improves the global cognitive functionality, verbal and 
      visual memory, as well as the level of attention. At the same time we observed a 
      decrease of the plasmatic level of C, of the cytokines, and an increase of the 
      expression of mRNA and protein of WIP-1. The analysis of correlations highlighted 
      that the level of the mRNA of WIP-1 was positively associated to the MMSE score, and 
      negatively to the C and cytokine levels. In conclusion, we purpose the MT as tool 
      that could help support successful aging through the improving of memory, attention 
      and global cognitive function performance. Furthermore, this approach could 
      participate to maintain lower the peripheral levels of the C and pro-inflammatory 
      cytokines. The WIP-1 as a potential new target of the pathophysiology of aging is 
      theorized.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment (CI) that arises in some older adults limits 
      independence and decreases quality of life. Cognitive stimulation programs delivered 
      by professional therapists have been shown to help maintain cognitive abilities, but 
      the costs of such programming are prohibitive. The present study explored the 
      feasibility and efficacy of using long-term care homes' volunteers to administer a 
      cognitive stimulation program to residents. METHODS: Thirty-six resident 
      participants and 16 volunteers were alternately assigned to one of two parallel 
      groups: a control group (CG) or stimulation group (SG). For eight weeks, three times 
      each week, CG participants met for standard "friendly visits" (casual conversation 
      between a resident and volunteer) and SG participants met to work through a variety 
      of exercises to stimulate residents' reasoning, attention, and memory abilities. 
      Resident participants were pre- and post-tested using the Weschler Abbreviated Scale 
      of Intelligence-Second Edition, Test of Memory, and Learning-Senior Edition, a 
      modified Letter Sorting test (LS), Clock Drawing Test (CDT), and the Action Word 
      Verbal Fluency Test. RESULTS: Two-way analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) controlling 
      for dementia diagnosis indicated statistically greater improvements in the 
      stimulation participants than in the control participants in Immediate Verbal 
      Memory, p = 0.011; Non-Verbal Memory, p = 0.012; Learning, p = 0.016; and Verbal 
      Fluency, p = 0.024. CONCLUSIONS: The feasibility and efficiency of a 
      volunteer-administered cognitive stimulation program was demonstrated. Longitudinal 
      studies with larger sample sizes are recommended in order to continue investigating 
      the breadth and depth volunteer roles in the maintenance of the cognitive abilities 
      of older adults.

PG  - 722-8
LID - 10.1007/s12603-015-0635-4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Attrition is one of the greatest difficulties in longitudinal studies on 
      cognitive ageing because of the associated risk of underestimating declines. The 
      aims of this paper were to characterize the magnitude and selectivity of attrition 
      in a study of mild cognitive impairment. DESIGN: Forty two patients with 
      multiple-domain amnestic MCI, 71 with single-domain amnestic MCI, 35 with 
      non-amnestic MCI and 318 healthy controls were recruited from primary care centers 
      and assessed at baseline. MEASUREMENTS: All participants underwent extensive 
      neuropsychological evaluation, including the Mini-Mental State Examination, the 
      Californian Verbal Learning Test, the CAMCOG-R battery, the Counting Span task and 
      Listening Span task, and the Subjective Memory Complaints Questionnaire. RESULTS: 
      21.5% of the participants at baseline did not participate in the follow-up 
      assessment. Comparison between respondents and non-returners did not reveal 
      differences in cognitive performance in the MCI group. Data obtained at the initial 
      assessment regarding comorbidity, social activities and attention given to memory 
      training enabled prediction of the status of the participants in the follow-up 
      assessment. CONCLUSION: Identification of potential non- returners is relevant, 
      especially in MCI studies, in order to develop retention strategies to minimize 
      attrition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Longevity can be accompanied by several challenges, among them cognitive 
      decline. The early identification of cognitive impairment offers the opportunity to 
      act with the aim of preventing or delaying dementia. One potential intervention 
      measure is MT. OBJECTIVES: To test the effect of MT in a sample of older individuals 
      previously identified as having MCI. METHODS: A randomized controlled clinical trial 
      was carried out. Subjects were recruited by the local media for a memory study and 
      were submitted to a battery of cognitive tests. Subjects meeting inclusion criteria 
      (n=112) were classified as normal controls (n=65) and MCI (n=47), according to 
      Gauthier and Touchon's criteria (Gauthier & Touchon, 2005). The study sample was 
      randomly assigned to three different intervention groups: MT group, educational 
      intervention (EI) group, and control group (CG). The MT group received eight 
      training sessions to learn mnemonic strategies based on ecological tasks. They also 
      completed tasks which recruited attention and executive functions. Educational 
      content on memory and aging was also offered. The EI participated in the same number 
      of sessions, yet, only the educational content was offered. The CG completed pre- 
      and post-test evaluations, and received training afterwards. RESULTS: Training 
      effects were modest and for certain variables they were equivalent to retest 
      effects. However, after training, individuals with MCI in the MT group exhibited 
      cognitive performance typical of individuals without cognitive impairment, 
      suggesting cognitive plasticity. CONCLUSION: MT is a feasible non-pharmacological 
      intervention which might bring positive performance change in older adults facing 
      cognitive impairment.

      cognitive impairment.
PG  - CD006220
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD006220.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence from some, but not all non-randomised studies suggest the 
      possibility that cognitive training may influence cognitive functioning in older 
      people. Due to the differences among cognitive training interventions reported in 
      the literature, giving a general overview of the current literature remains 
      difficult. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the literature and summarize the 
      effect of cognitive training interventions on various domains of cognitive function 
      (ie memory, executive function, attention and speed) in healthy older people and in 
      people with mild cognitive impairment. SEARCH STRATEGY: The CDCIG Specialized 
      Register was searched on 30 September 2007 for all years up to December 2005. The 
      Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL were searched separately on 
      30 September 2007 to find trials with healthy people. These results were 
      supplemented by searches from January 1970 to September 2007 in PsychInfo/Psyndex, 
      ISI Web of Knowledge and PubMed. SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs of interventions 
      evaluating the effectiveness of cognitive training for healthy older people and 
      people with mild cognitive impairment from 1970 to 2007 that met inclusion criteria 
      were selected. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Authors independently extracted data 
      and assessed trial quality. Meta-analysis was performed when appropriate. MAIN 
      RESULTS: Only data on memory training could be pooled for analysis. Within this 
      domain, training interventions were grouped according to several outcome variables. 
      Results showed that for healthy older adults, immediate and delayed verbal recall 
      improved significantly through training compared to a no-treatment control 
      condition. We did not find any specific memory training effects though as the 
      improvements observed did not exceed the improvement in the active control 
      condition. For individuals with mild cognitive impairment, our analyses demonstrate 
      the same pattern. Thus, there is currently little evidence on the effectiveness and 
      specificity of memory interventions for healthy older adults and individuals with 
      mild cognitive impairment. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence that cognitive 
      interventions do lead to performance gains but none of the effects observed could be 
      attributable specifically to cognitive training, as the improvements observed did 
      not exceed the improvement in active control conditions. This does not mean that 
      longer, more intense or different interventions might not be effective, but that 
      those which have been reported thus far have only limited effect. We therefore 
      suggest more standardized study protocols in order to maximize comparability of 
      studies and to maximize the possibility of data pooling - also in other cognitive 
      domains than memory.

PG  - 1153-7
LID - 10.1007/s10072-016-2553-6 [doi]
AB  - Subjective cognitive and memory complaints (SMC) are common in later life and are 
      considered an indicator for progression to cognitive decline. The aim of the present 
      study was to identify the relationship among SMC, neuropsychiatric symptoms and 
      psychological aspects in elderly subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as 
      well as to analyse the effect on SMC of a comprehensive cognitive training. Data 
      from a sample of 94 patients enrolled in 'My Mind Project' (Grant No. 
      154/GR-2009-1584108) were collected. The study evidenced that depression was a 
      significant predictor of SMC and that after the training, the number of subjects 
      with SMC was significantly reduced in the experimental group in comparison to the 
      control one. These results suggest that the participation in cognitive stimulation 
      protocols may improve the perception of SMC in subjects with MCI.

AB  - The aim of the present report was to evaluate the effectiveness and impact of 
      multisensory and cognitive stimulation on improving cognition in elderly persons 
      living in long-term-care institutions (institutionalized [I]) or in communities with 
      their families (noninstitutionalized [NI]). We compared neuropsychological 
      performance using language and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) test scores 
      before and after 24 and 48 stimulation sessions. The two groups were matched by age 
      and years of schooling. Small groups of ten or fewer volunteers underwent the 
      stimulation program, twice a week, over 6 months (48 sessions in total). Sessions 
      were based on language and memory exercises, as well as visual, olfactory, auditory, 
      and ludic stimulation, including music, singing, and dance. Both groups were 
      assessed at the beginning (before stimulation), in the middle (after 24 sessions), 
      and at the end (after 48 sessions) of the stimulation program. Although the NI group 
      showed higher performance in all tasks in all time windows compared with I subjects, 
      both groups improved their performance after stimulation. In addition, the 
      improvement was significantly higher in the I group than the NI group. Language 
      tests seem to be more efficient than the MMSE to detect early changes in cognitive 
      status. The results suggest the impoverished environment of long-term-care 
      institutions may contribute to lower cognitive scores before stimulation and the 
      higher improvement rate of this group after stimulation. In conclusion, language 
      tests should be routinely adopted in the neuropsychological assessment of elderly 
      subjects, and long-term-care institutions need to include regular sensorimotor, 
      social, and cognitive stimulation as a public health policy for elderly persons.

AB  - Brain aging and aging-related neurodegenerative disorders are major health 
      challenges faced by modern societies. Brain aging is associated with cognitive and 
      functional decline and represents the favourable background for the onset and 
      development of dementia. Brain aging is associated with early and subtle 
      anatomo-functional physiological changes that often precede the appearance of 
      clinical signs of cognitive decline. Neuroimaging approaches unveiled the functional 
      correlates of these alterations and helped in the identification of therapeutic 
      targets that can be potentially useful in counteracting age-dependent cognitive 
      decline. A growing body of evidence supports the notion that cognitive stimulation 
      and aerobic training can preserve and enhance operational skills in elderly 
      individuals as well as reduce the incidence of dementia. This review aims at 
      providing an extensive and critical overview of the most recent data that support 
      the efficacy of non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions aimed at 
      enhancing cognition and brain plasticity in healthy elderly individuals as well as 
      delaying the cognitive decline associated with dementia.

LID - 10.1177/1533317512441386 [doi]
AB  - Nowadays, preventing the effects of mental decline is an international priority, but 
      there is little research into cognitive training in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). 
      We present the results of a program aimed at teaching memory strategies and 
      improving metacognitive abilities. This was associated with training to ameliorate 
      caregivers' assistance. Two groups (A and B) were compared in a crossover design. 
      After the first evaluation, group A (but not B) participated in a 6-month cognitive 
      stimulation program. After a second assessment, only B received treatment and then a 
      final evaluation was carried out on both the groups. The results show that (1) both 
      the groups improved their performance as an effect of training; (2) improvements are 
      specific to the functions trained; (3) in the interval without intervention, 
      performance of group B worsened; and (4) group A has maintained their results over 
      time. In conclusion, our results show that specific training may reduce memory 
      impairment in MCI.

TI  - Cuba's Strategy for Alzheimer Disease and Dementia Syndromes.
PG  - 9-13
AB  - Dementia is a great challenge to public health in Cuba due to its impact on society 
      and families. Cuba's National Intervention Strategy for Alzheimer Disease and 
      Dementia Syndromes is designed to address this challenge. The Strategy includes 
      working guidelines for primary and secondary care, education about rights of people 
      with cognitive impairment, professional development, research, and health promotion 
      and dementia prevention. An associated action plan, focused on primary care, 
      includes proposals for creation of memory clinics, day centers and comprehensive 
      rehabilitation services for cognitive stimulation. Short-term measures proposed 
      include increasing early detection; creating a dementia morbidity and mortality 
      registry; promoting professional training; providing support for families; and 
      promoting basic and clinical research on dementia. Medium-term proposals aim to 
      reduce dementia incidence and mortality by controlling risk factors and promoting 
      healthy lifestyles, offering new treatment options and optimizing early detection. A 
      set of indicators has been developed to evaluate strategy implementation. With this 
      strategy, Cuba joins the small number of developing countries that have responded to 
      WHO's call to improve care for patients with dementia and alleviate its impact on 
      society and families. KEYWORDS Dementia, Alzheimer disease, aging, national health 
      programs, social stigma, primary prevention, health promotion, civil rights, Cuba.

TI  - Improved working memory following novel combinations of physical and cognitive 
      activity.
PG  - 523-32
LID - 10.1177/1545968311425919 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In humans, retrospective studies suggest that habitual physical activity 
      (PA) or cognitive activity (CA) can help maintain or improve cognitive function. 
      Similar findings have been reported using physical exercise in animal studies; 
      however, the exercise paradigms differ markedly in duration and frequency, making 
      extrapolation difficult. Here, the authors present a novel PA and CA paradigm that 
      combines voluntary wheel running with Hebb-Williams and radial arm maze (RAM) 
      training. METHODS: A total of 57 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 
      treatment groups: the PA, CA, and combined PA and CA groups and sedentary controls. 
      PA (voluntary wheel running) and CA (Hebb-Williams mazes) consisted of a moderate 2 
      h/d, 5 d/wk treatment paradigm. RESULTS: Animals exposed to a combination of PA and 
      CA made significantly fewer working memory errors and exhibited superior choice 
      accuracy when compared with animals exposed to either PA or CA alone in the 8-arm 
      baited configuration of the RAM. Additional analyses revealed that the cognitive 
      improvements were independent of exercise intensity/duration. Assessment of 
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels revealed a significant increase in 
      hippocampal BDNF only in the PA-alone group. CONCLUSION: A novel combination of PA 
      and CA improves learning and memory abilities independent of activity intensity, 
      BDNF, or phosphorylated cyclic AMP response element binding protein levels. This is 
      the first report of significant changes in cognitive ability using a paradigm 
      involving moderate levels of PA plus cognitive stimulation. An adaptation of this 
      paradigm may be particularly beneficial in slowing the development of mild cognitive 
      impairment and subsequent dementia in elderly people.

TI  - The Impact of Three Cognitive Training Programs on Driving Cessation Across 10 
      Years: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 838-846
LID - 10.1093/geront/gnw143 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Driving is important for older adults' health and well-being, 
      yet little research has examined interventions to maintain driving mobility. As 
      fluid cognitive abilities are strongly linked to driving, targeted cognitive 
      training interventions may impact driving mobility longitudinally. This study 
      assessed the effects of three different cognitive training programs (reasoning, 
      speed of processing, and memory) on driving cessation in older adults across 10 
      years (n = 2,390). DESIGN AND METHODS: Cox regression analyses evaluated the impact 
      of each program relative to a no-contact control group with intent-to-treat (ITT) 
      analyses. The effects of randomization to additional booster sessions were also 
      examined. Subsample analyses repeated these models in participants who were at-risk 
      for driving mobility declines. RESULTS: There were no training (n = 2,390) or 
      booster training (n = 1,540) effects on driving cessation with ITT analyses. 
      Individuals at-risk for future mobility declines were 49% (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.51, 
      95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.28, 0.94; n = 336) less likely to cease driving 
      after speed of processing training and 55% (HR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.24, 0.86; n = 324) 
      less likely to quit driving subsequent to reasoning training. Additional booster 
      sessions for speed of processing training resulted in a 70% reduction of driving 
      cessation (HR = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.82; n = 252) in the subsample analyses. There 
      were no significant effects of memory training. IMPLICATIONS: Some cognitive 
      interventions transfer to maintained driving among those at-risk for mobility 
      declines due to cognitive impairment. Future research should identify moderators and 
      mediators of training and transfer effects.

AB  - Executive functions play an important role in the maintenance of autonomy in 
      day-to-day activities. Nevertheless, there is little research into specific 
      cognitive training for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). We present the results of a 
      program which aims to teach specific strategies and metacognitive abilities in order 
      for patients to be able to carry out attentional and executive tasks. Two groups (A 
      and B) were compared in a cross-over design. After the first evaluation, Group A 
      (but not B) participated in a six month cognitive stimulation program. After a 
      second assessment, only Group B received treatment and then a final evaluation was 
      carried out on both groups. The results show that: i) both groups improved their 
      performance as an effect of training; ii) improvements generalized to memory and 
      general cognitive tasks; iii) in the interval without training, Group B's 
      performance worsened and iv) Group A partially maintained their results over time.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the self-perception of memory in elderly 
      illiterate with mild cognitive impairment, before and after workshops of cognitive 
      stimulation adapted for illiterate individuals. The research was qualitative, held 
      at the Health Unit of Taguatinga-DF, involving 63 elderly illiterate: 22 in the 
      experimental group (EG), with 10 workshops; 21 in control group 1 (CG1), with 10 
      lectures; and 20 in the control group 2 (GC2), without intervention. Semi-structured 
      interviews were carried on before and after the interventions, asking about memory 
      status. The activities offered weekly to EG and CG1 have had two hours of duration. 
      The mean age of the participants was 72.8 years, and 92% were female. In 
      pre-intervention, 82% reported worsening memory during the last year. In 
      post-intervention, CG1 and CG2 kept memory changes, while EG improved cognition. One 
      concludes that the provided workshops and lectures improved functionality and 
      socialization / integration.

AB  - PURPOSE: Adaptation to blindness can lead to the enhancement of the attentional 
      capacities and working memory in young people. However, although the effects of 
      ageing on the cognition of sighted people and people with age-related visual 
      impairments are well-documented, no study seems to have investigated the age-related 
      changes of these cognitive processes in people who are blind. The aim of this study 
      was to assess the effects of age on the attentional processes and working memory in 
      blind people. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 43 blind participants 
      and 42 sighted participants. The participants performed auditory computerized tests 
      assessing selective, sustained and divided attention, attentional switching, and 
      working memory. RESULTS: Two-way analysis of variance revealed significant visual 
      status effect and age effect on most of the variables studied. No interaction was 
      found between visual status and age effects. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that 
      the trajectories of cognitive age-related change are similar in blind people and in 
      sighted people. This study has implications for rehabilitation, such as cognitive 
      intervention. Implications for Rehabilitation Blind people show improved attentional 
      capacities compared to sighted people, even in old blind people. Old blind people 
      have lower performances than younger blind people in tests assessing selective, 
      sustained and divided attention, and working memory. Cognitive approaches to 
      rehabilitation may help people who are blind to deal with age-related cognitive 
      decline and its effects on everyday functioning. A high level of cognitive 
      stimulation, provided by a cognitive training or a developed social participation, 
      might reduce the age-related effects in people who are blind.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: According to the increase of older people, the need for effective methods 
      to maintain or improve cognitive functions in the elderly has increased. These 
      cognitive enhancing methods may contribute to the prevention of elderly cognitive 
      decline by aging and dementing illness as well. This study aimed to examine the 
      effectiveness of multistrategic memory training with the metamemory concept on 
      cognitive functions in the normal health elderly in Korea. METHODS: The program used 
      in this study was developed by psychiatrists and psychologists in accordance with 
      Korean situations. We applied the training program to the community-dwelling elderly 
      with subjective memory complaints. Twenty participants were randomly received the 
      intervention with 20 non-treatment controls. This program consisted of 10 sessions 
      and was administered once a week. We examined the effects of this memory training 
      for verbal memory, visuospatial memory, working memory, and verbal fluency ability 
      by repeated ANOVA. RESULTS: There were significant improvements in Word List 
      Short-term Delayed Free and Cued Recall, Word list Long-term Delayed Free and Cued 
      Recall and visuospatial recognition memory. Performance improvements in visuospatial 
      span forwards and the Categorical Fluency Test were also significant. These 
      improvements were still significant after adjusting for depression improvement exact 
      categorical fluency. CONCLUSION: This study shows that multistrategic memory 
      training with the metamemory concept may improve memory ability and other cognitive 
      functions which are not trained and that these improvements may be achieved by pure 
      cognitive training effects.

AB  - The mammalian hippocampus shows marked decline in function with aging across many 
      species, including humans and laboratory rodent models. This decline frequently 
      manifests in memory impairments that occur even in the absence of dementia 
      pathology. In humans, a number of factors correlate with preserved hippocampal 
      memory in aging, such as exercise, cognitive stimulation and number of social ties. 
      While interventional studies and animal models clearly indicate that exercise and 
      cognitive stimulation lead to hippocampal preservation, there is relatively little 
      research on whether a decline in social ties leads to cognitive decline or vice 
      versa. Even in animal studies of environmental enrichment in aging, the focus 
      typically falls on physical enrichment such as a rotating cast of toys, rather than 
      the role of social interactions. The present studies investigated the hypothesis 
      that a greater number of social ties in aging mice would lead to improved 
      hippocampal function. Aged, female C57/Bl6 mice were housed for 3 months in pairs or 
      large groups (7 mice per cage). Group-housed mice showed greater novel object 
      location memory and stronger preference for a spatial navigation strategy in the 
      Barnes maze, though no difference in escape latency, compared to pair-housed mice. 
      Group-housed mice did not differ from pair-housed mice in basal corticosterone 
      levels or adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Group-housed mice did, however, show 
      reduced numbers of Iba1/CD68+ microglia in the hippocampus. These findings suggest 
      that group housing led to better memory function and reduced markers of 
      neuroinflammation in aged mice. More broadly, they support a causative link between 
      social ties and hippocampal function, suggesting that merely having a larger social 
      network can positively influence the aging brain. Future research should address the 
      molecular mechanisms by which a greater number of social ties alters hippocampal 
      function.

PG  - 1543-1554
LID - 10.2147/CIA.S152225 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore whether a computerized cognitive stimulation 
      program (CCS) induced differential effects in older adults with mild cognitive 
      impairment (MCI) according to the severity of white matter hyperintensities (WMH), 
      which are associated with cognitive impairment and increased risk of progression to 
      Alzheimer's disease because of the damage they cause to cortical and subcortical 
      networks. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine MCI patients with no or little WMH 
      (MCI-non-WMH) and 22 MCI patients with moderate or severe WMH (MCI-WMH) attended a 
      24-session CCS program (two sessions per week for a duration of 3 months) focused on 
      executive functions, attention, and processing speed. Cognitive and psychosocial 
      assessments were performed at baseline, postintervention, and 3 months after the 
      intervention. RESULTS: Both groups improved on several cognitive measures after the 
      intervention. However, the MCI-non-WMH group improved on a higher number of 
      cognitive measures than the MCI-WMH group. At postintervention assessment, CCS had a 
      more beneficial effect on the MCI-non-WMH group than on the MCI-WMH group with 
      regard to improving categorical fluency (4.6±6.8 vs 0.4±6.4; effect size=0.37; 
      p=0.002). During the 3-month follow-up assessment, significantly higher score 
      improvements were observed in the MCI-non-WMH group for the paired-associate 
      learning test (6.4±3 vs 4.7±3.5 points; effect size=0.43; p=0.005) as well as 
      categorical fluency (3.8±7.8 vs -0.7±6 points; effect size=0.55; p=0.0003). 
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that WMH severity was related to cognitive

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide evidence of the effectiveness of a community health 
      intervention, that includes a cognitive stimulation program, to prevent the 
      deterioration of cognitive abilities in our population of elderly people with normal 
      cognition that are living in the community. DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial 
      (CONSORT group norms) LOCATION: San José Norte-Centro Health Center and La Caridad 
      Foundation (Zaragoza, Spain). PARTICIPANTS: 201 people aged 65 or older, with a MEC 
      score of at least 28 points, which were randomized between the Intervention group 
      (101) and the Control group (100). INTERVENTION: The intervention was applied in 10 
      sessions of 45minutes, one per week. It used materials designed by one of the 
      authors, which addressed the following areas: memory, orientation, language, praxis, 
      gnosis, calculation, perception, logical reasoning, attention-concentration and 
      programming. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: The main outcome variables were MEC, Set-Test, 
      Barthel and Lawton-Brody. RESULTS: Increases of the main result variables over their 
      baseline level were analized. For MEC variable, the Intervention group obtained, on 
      average, 1.58 points more than the Control group in the evaluation performed 
      immediately after the intervention. After 6months, the improvement was 1.51 points 
      and after a year, it was of 2.04 points. All these differences were statistically 
      significant. For Set-Test, Barthel and Lawton-Brody variables, no statistically 
      significant differences were observed between Intervention group and Control group. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive stimulation with our program is effective to maintain or 
      improve cognitive performance, measured with the variable MEC, our population of 
      elderly people with normal cognition that are living in the community. There is no 
      evidence that this improvement is transferred to the activities of daily life 
      measured with Barthel and Lawton-Brody variables.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate maintenance of training effects of a novel brain 
      plasticity-based computerized cognitive training program in older adults after a 
      3-month no-contact period. DESIGN: Multisite, randomized, controlled, double-blind 
      trial with two treatment groups. SETTING: Communities in northern and southern 
      California and Minnesota. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred eighty-seven community-dwelling 
      adults aged 65 and older without diagnosis of clinically significant cognitive 
      impairment. INTERVENTION: Random assignment into a broadly available brain 
      plasticity-based computerized cognitive training program experimental group or a 
      novelty- and intensity-matched cognitive stimulation active control. Assessments at 
      baseline, after training, and at 3 months. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was a 
      composite of auditory subtests of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of 
      Neuropsychological Status. Secondary measures included trained task performance, 
      standardized neuropsychological assessments of overall memory and attention, and 
      participant-reported outcomes (PROs). RESULTS: A significant difference in 
      improvement from baseline to 3-month follow-up was seen between the experimental 
      training and control groups on the secondary composite of overall memory and 
      attention, (P=.01, d=0.25), the trained processing-speed measure (P<.001, d=0.80), 
      word list total recall (P=.004, d=0.28), letter-number sequencing (P=.003, d=0.29), 
      and the cognitive subscale of PRO (P=.006, d=0.27). Previously significant 
      improvements became nonsignificant at the 3-month follow-up for the primary outcome, 
      two secondary measures of attention and memory, and several PROs. Narrative memory 
      continued to show no advantage for the experimental group. Effect sizes from 
      baseline to follow-up were generally smaller than effect sizes from baseline to 
      posttraining. CONCLUSION: Training effects were maintained but waned over the 
      3-month no-contact period.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Working memory impairment in individuals with chronic opioid dependence 
      can play a major role in cognitive and treatment outcomes. Cognitive training 
      targeting working memory shows promise for improved function in substance use 
      disorders. To date, cognitive training has not been incorporated as an adjunctive 
      treatment for opioid dependence. METHODS: Methadone maintenance patients were 
      randomly assigned to experimental (n=28) or active control (n=28) 25-session 
      computerized training and run in parallel. Cognitive and drug use outcomes were 
      assessed before and after training. RESULTS: Participants in the experimental 
      condition showed performance improvements on two of four working memory measures, 
      and both groups improved on a third measure of working memory performance. Less 
      frequent drug use was found in the experimental group than in the control group 
      post-training. In contrast to previous findings with stimulant users, no significant 
      effect of working memory training on delay discounting was found using either 
      hypothetical or real rewards. There were no group differences on working memory 
      outcome measures that were dissimilar from the training tasks, suggesting that 
      another mechanism (e.g., increased distress tolerance) may have driven drug use 
      results. CONCLUSIONS: Working memory training improves performance on some measures 
      of working memory in methadone maintenance patients, and may impact drug use 
      outcomes. Working memory training shows promise in patients with substance use 
      disorders; however, further research is needed to understand the mechanisms through 
      which performance is improved and drug use outcomes are impacted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A better understanding of people with cognitive disorders improves 
      performance on memory tasks through memory-focused interventions are needed. 
      OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of memoryfocused 
      interventions on cognitive disorders through a meta-analysis. DESIGN: Systematic 
      review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: The online electronic databases PubMed, the 
      Cochrane Library, Ovid-Medline, CINHAL, PsycINFO, Ageline, and Embase (up to May 
      2017) were used in this study. No language restriction was applied to the search. 
      REVIEW METHODS: Objective memory (learning and memory function, immediate recall, 
      delayed recall, and recognition) was the primary indicator and subjective memory 
      performance, global cognitive function, and depression were the secondary 
      indicators. The Hedges' g of change, subgroup analyses, and meta-regression were 
      analyzed on the basis of the characteristics of people with cognitive disorders. 
      RESULTS: A total of 27 studies (2177 participants, mean age=75.80) reporting RCTs 
      were included in the meta-analysis. The results indicated a medium-to-large effect 
      of memory-focused interventions on learning and memory function (Hedges' g=0.62) and 
      subjective memory performance (Hedges' g=0.67), a small-to-medium effect on delayed 
      recall and depression, and a small effect on immediate recall and global cognitive 
      function (all p<0.05) compared with the control. Subgroup analysis and 
      meta-regression indicated that the effects on learning and memory function were more 
      profound in the format of memory training, individual training, shorter treatment 
      duration, and more than eight treatment sessions, and the effect size indicated the 
      MMSE score was the most crucial indicator (β=-0.06, p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: This is 
      first comprehensive meta-analysis of special memory domains in people with cognitive 
      disorders. The results revealed that memory-focused interventions effectively 
      improved memory-related performance in people with cognitive disorders. An 
      appropriately designed intervention can effectively improve memory function, reduce 
      disability progression, and improve mood state in people with cognitive disorders. 
      Additional randomized controlled trials including measures of recognition, global 
      cognitive function, and depression should be conducted and analyzed.

AB  - Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent and unpredictable 
      interruptions of normal brain function, that implies neurobiologic, psychological, 
      and social consequences. Non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is an 
      electro-clinical state associated to altered level of consciousness. In NCSE could 
      occur the behavioural and emotional disorder, cognitive impairment and psychiatric 
      disorder with a negative impact on quality of life and adaptive social behaviours. 
      Cognitive rehabilitation for epileptic patients may include internal compensation 
      strategies, external memory aids, psychoeducation, verbal and visual memory 
      training, attention exercise and executive functions. We described the cognitive 
      rehabilitation in a patient with NCSE characterized by an unusual cognitive 
      impairment. A 55-year-old female patient, with epileptic seizures presented a severe 
      impairment in cognitive function and focal neurological deficit. The cognitive 
      treatment was designed as a combination of direct training of the impaired functions 
      and metacognitive training to facilitate the development of compensatory strategies 
      and it was divided into three methods. Neuropsychological evaluation showed a 
      progressive deficit of high cognitive functions. The patient after cognitive 
      rehabilitation, demonstrated a significant recovery of motor abilities, despite the 
      neuro-cognitive profile was abnormal. Several advances have been made in this field 
      but few studies on neuropsychological rehabilitation in adult patients with NCSE 
      have been conducted and no standardized protocol or clinical guidelines are still 
      available.

LID - 10.3233/JAD-131889 [doi]
AB  - Subjective memory impairment (SMI) is a common risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, 
      with few established options for treatment. Here we investigate the effects of two 
      months episodic memory training on regional brain atrophy in 19 memory clinic 
      patients with SMI. We used a sensitive longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging 
      protocol and compared the patients with 42 matched healthy volunteers randomly 
      assigned to a group performing the same training, or a no-training control group. 
      Following intervention, the SMI sample exhibited structural gray matter volume 
      increases in brain regions encompassing the episodic memory network, with cortical 
      volume expansion of comparable extent as healthy training participants. Further, we 
      found significant hippocampal volume increases in the healthy training group but not 
      in the SMI group. Still, individual differences in left hippocampal volume change in 
      the patient group were related to verbal recall improvement following training. The 
      present results reinforce earlier studies indicating intact brain plasticity in 
      aging, and further suggest that training-related brain changes can be evident also 
      in the earliest form of cognitive impairment.

AB  - The objective of this pilot study was to investigate how a memory training technique 
      called "Spaced Retrieval" (SR) might be effectively applied in helping persons with 
      Alzheimer's disease improve their recall of recent events. Capitalising on the 
      interdependence among spared and impaired memory systems, it was hypothesised that 
      SR training with support at encoding and retrieval would facilitate the retention 
      and recall of meaningful recent events. Eight participants with a diagnosis of 
      Alzheimer's disease or related disorder were recruited for this study. The study 
      employed a quasi-experimental multiple baseline treatment design across 
      participants, items, and behaviours. SR training was provided in three domains: 
      Semantic, Prospective, and Episodic recent memory. The results show important 
      training gains made by all participants across conditions at post-training 
      follow-up. In the Episodic condition, participants were able to recall specific 
      details about recent events following training. This study provides preliminary 
      evidence that individuals with mild to severe cognitive impairment can learn and 
      recall new episodic information through Spaced Retrieval training. If replicated, 
      these findings would support the use of Spaced Retrieval as an intervention tool to 
      help individuals maintain their functioning in the area of episodic recent memory.

      age.
PG  - 79-87
LID - 10.1159/000324240 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Old-old age (80+ years) is associated with substantial cognitive 
      decline. In this population, training-induced cognitive plasticity has rarely been 
      studied. While earlier findings on strategy trainings suggested reduced training 
      gains in old-old age, recent results of an extensive process-based working memory 
      (WM) training have been more positive. OBJECTIVE: Following up on previous research, 
      the present study aimed at examining the effects of a short WM training in old-old 
      adults and the influence of baseline WM capacity on training gains. METHODS: A 
      training group (mean age: 86.8 years) and a matched control group (mean age: 87.1 
      years) participated in the study. The WM training consisted of five tasks that were 
      trained in each of 10 sessions. To evaluate possible transfer effects, executive 
      functions were assessed with two tests before and after training. The training group 
      was divided via median split in high- and low-capacity individuals to determine the 
      influence of baseline WM capacity on training gains. RESULTS: The training group 
      improved in four of the trained tasks (medium-to-large effects). Training gains were 
      significantly larger in the training group than in the control group in only two of 
      those tasks. The training effects were mainly driven by the low-capacity individuals 
      who improved in all trained tasks. No transfer effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These positive effects of a short WM training, particularly for low-capacity 
      individuals, emphasize the potential for cognitive plasticity in old-old age. The 
      absence of transfer effects may also point to its limits.

LID - 10.4306/pi.2014.11.1.52 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Ubiquitous Spaced Retrieval-based Memory Advancement and 
      Rehabilitation Training (USMART) program was developed by transforming the spaced 
      retrieval-based memory training which consisted of 24 face-to-face sessions into a 
      self-administered program with an iPAD app. The objective of this study was to 
      evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of USMART in elderly subjects with mild 
      cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: Feasibility was evaluated by checking the 
      satisfaction of the participants with a 5-point Likert scale. The efficacy of the 
      program on cognitive functions was evaluated by the Korean version of the Consortium 
      to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Neuropsychological Assessment 
      Battery before and after USMART. RESULTS: Among the 10 participants, 7 completed 
      both pre- and post-USMART assessments. The overall satisfaction score was 8.0±1.0 
      out of 10. The mean Word List Memory Test (WLMT) scores significantly increased 
      after USMART training after adjusting for age, educational levels, baseline 
      Mini-Mental Status Examination scores, and the number of training sessions 
      (pre-USMART, 16.0±4.1; post-USMART, 17.9±4.5; p=0.014, RM-ANOVA). The magnitude of 
      the improvements in the WLMT scores significantly correlated with the number of 
      training sessions during 4 weeks (r=0.793; p=0.033). CONCLUSION: USMART was 
      effective in improving memory and was well tolerated by most participants with MCI, 
      suggesting that it may be a convenient and cost-effective alternative for the 
      cognitive rehabilitation of elderly subjects with cognitive impairments. Further 
      studies with large numbers of participants are necessary to examine the relationship 
      between the number of training sessions and the improvements in memory function.

AB  - Cognitive rehabilitation for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's 
      disease is readily available to the geriatric population. Initial evidence suggests 
      that techniques incorporating motivational strategies to enhance treatment 
      engagement may provide more benefit than computerised training alone. Seventy four 
      adults with subclinical cognitive decline were randomly assigned to computerised 
      cognitive training (CCT), Cognitive Vitality Training (CVT), or an Active Control 
      Group (ACG), and underwent neuropsychological evaluations at baseline and four-month 
      follow-up. Significant differences were found in changes in performance on the 
      Modified Mini Mental State Examination (mMMSE) and measures of verbal learning and 
      memory across treatment groups. Experimental groups showed greater preservation of 
      functioning on the mMMSE than the ACG group, the CVT group performed better than the 
      ACG group on one measure of verbal learning and both measures of verbal memory, and 
      the CCT group performed better than the ACG group on one measure of verbal learning 
      and one measure of verbal memory. There were no significant group differences 
      between the CVT and CCT groups on measures of verbal learning or memory. It was 
      concluded that computerised cognitive training may offer the most benefit when 
      incorporated into a therapeutic milieu rather than administered alone, although both 
      appear superior to more generic forms of cognitive stimulation.

TI  - A Combined Cognitive Stimulation and Physical Exercise Programme (MINDVital) in 
      Early Dementia: Differential Effects on Single- and Dual-Task Gait Performance.
PG  - 604-610
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gait disorders are common in early dementia, with particularly 
      pronounced dual-task deficits, contributing to the increased fall risk and mobility 
      decline associated with cognitive impairment. OBJECTIVE: This study examines the 
      effects of a combined cognitive stimulation and physical exercise programme 
      (MINDVital) on gait performance under single- and dual-task conditions in older 
      adults with mild dementia. METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with early dementia 
      participated in a multi-disciplinary rehabilitation programme comprising both 
      physical exercise and cognitive stimulation. The programme was conducted in 8-week 
      cycles with participants attending once weekly, and all participants completed 2 
      successive cycles. Cognitive, functional performance and behavioural symptoms were 
      assessed at baseline and at the end of each 8-week cycle. Gait speed was examined 
      under both single- (Timed Up and Go and 6-metre walk tests) and dual-task (animal 
      category and serial counting) conditions. A random effects model was performed for 
      the independent effect of MINDVital on the primary outcome variable of gait speed 
      under dual-task conditions. RESULTS: The mean age of patients enroled in the 
      rehabilitation programme was 79 ± 6.2 years; 25 (64.1%) had a diagnosis of 
      Alzheimer's dementia, and 26 (66.7%) were receiving a cognitive enhancer therapy. 
      There was a significant improvement in cognitive performance [random effects 
      coefficient (standard error) = 0.90 (0.31), p = 0.003] and gait speed under both 
      dual-task situations [animal category: random effects coefficient = 0.04 (0.02), p = 
      0.039; serial counting: random effects coefficient = 0.05 (0.02), p = 0.013], with 
      reduced dual-task cost for gait speed [serial counting: random effects coefficient = 
      -4.05 (2.35), p = 0.086] following successive MINDVital cycles. No significant 
      improvement in single-task gait speed was observed. Improved cognitive performance 
      over time was a significant determinant of changes in dual-task gait speed [random 
      effects coefficients = 0.01 (0.005), p = 0.048, and 0.02 (0.005), p = 0.003 for 
      category fluency and counting backwards, respectively]. CONCLUSION: A combined 
      physical and cognitive rehabilitation programme leads to significant improvements in 
      dual-task walking in early dementia, which may be contributed by improvement in 
      cognitive performance, as single-task gait performance remained stable.

TI  - The Memory Aid study: protocol for a randomized controlled clinical trial evaluating 
      the effect of computer-based working memory training in elderly patients with mild 
      cognitive impairment (MCI).
PG  - 156
LID - 10.1186/1745-6215-15-156 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition characterized by memory 
      problems that are more severe than the normal cognitive changes due to aging, but 
      less severe than dementia. Reduced working memory (WM) is regarded as one of the 
      core symptoms of an MCI condition. Recent studies have indicated that WM can be 
      improved through computer-based training. The objective of this study is to evaluate 
      if WM training is effective in improving cognitive function in elderly patients with 
      MCI, and if cognitive training induces structural changes in the white and gray 
      matter of the brain, as assessed by structural MRI. METHODS/DESIGNS: The proposed 
      study is a blinded, randomized, controlled trail that will include 90 elderly 
      patients diagnosed with MCI at a hospital-based memory clinic. The participants will 
      be randomized to either a training program or a placebo version of the program. The 
      intervention is computerized WM training performed for 45 minutes of 25 sessions 
      over 5 weeks. The placebo version is identical in duration but is non-adaptive in 
      the difficulty level of the tasks. Neuropsychological assessment and structural MRI 
      will be performed before and 1 month after training, and at a 5-month folllow-up. 
      DISCUSSION: If computer-based training results in positive changes to memory 
      functions in patients with MCI this may represent a new, cost-effective treatment 
      for MCI. Secondly, evaluation of any training-induced structural changes to gray or 
      white matter will improve the current understanding of the mechanisms behind 
      effective cognitive interventions in patients with MCI. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in elderly with major 
      symptoms of a general term for memory loss and other intellectual abilities 
      impairment which are serious enough to interfere with daily life. While there is no 
      treatment can prevent and revise the cognitive function impairment in AD, physical 
      activity becomes a potential beneficial intervention for AD. Multiple evidences 
      suggested that exercise in general plays beneficial roles in improving brain 
      function. Most common mechanisms of exercise-induced enhancement of brain function 
      are including alteration of neurogenesis, neuron plasticity, neuronal signaling and 
      receptors, as well as neuronal networks. This mini review includes most recent 
      clinical studies and focuses on the effects of physical exercise, cognitive 
      stimulation, and combination of both physical and cognitive training on protection 
      and rescue cognitive decline in people with AD.

AB  - Working memory (WM) is one of the cognitive functions that is susceptible to 
      ageing-related decline. Interventions that are able to improve WM functioning at 
      older age are thus highly relevant. In this pilot study, we explored the transfer 
      effects of core WM training on the WM domain and other cognitive domains in 23 
      healthy older adults and 18 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI). 
      Performance on neuropsychological tests was assessed before and after completion of 
      the online five-week adaptive WM training, and after a three-month follow-up period. 
      After training, both groups improved on the Digit Span and Spatial Span, gains that 
      were maintained at follow-up. At an individual level, a limited number of 
      participants showed reliable training gain. Healthy older adults, and to a lesser 
      extent MCI patients, additionally improved on figural fluency at group level, but 
      not at individual level. Results furthermore showed that global brain atrophy and 
      hippocampal atrophy, as assessed by MRI, may negatively affect training outcome. Our 
      study examined core WM training, showing gains on trained and untrained tasks within 
      the WM domain, but no broad generalisation to other cognitive domains. More research 
      is needed to evaluate the clinical relevance of these findings and to identify 
      participant characteristics that are predictive of training gain.

PG  - 1361-78
LID - 10.1007/s00702-011-0663-0 [doi]
AB  - The affirmative position is argued in response to the question of whether 
      intervention in the disease course of Alzheimer disease (AD) occurs too late. AD is 
      not a singular, homogeneous disease, but rather a final common pathway or end-point 
      that can be arrived at through multiple routes. As part of the affirmative argument, 
      there is a delineation of two long-term trajectories leading to AD: (1) normal 
      elderly progression to AD, and (2) depressed elderly progression to AD. In 
      documenting normal elderly devolution into AD, two "normal" elderly pre-AD or 
      prodromal stages are discussed: age-associated memory impairment (AAMI) and mild 
      cognitive impairment (MCI). Data are provided evidencing significantly high 
      conversion rates from these pre-AD stages to actual AD. Using the same paradigmatic 
      approach that is used in documenting normal elderly decline into AAMI and MCI with 
      eventual conversion to AD; there is explication of depressed elderly conversion to 
      AD. The long-term, multiphasic disease progression of major depression without 
      dementia to depressive dementia to final conversion to AD is brought into focus as 
      another example of why intervention must occur prior to actual conversion to AD. 
      Depression is defined as a cognitive syndrome and risk factor for AD requiring 
      aggressive targeted intervention. AD does not just come suddenly out of nowhere. 
      First intervention must occur during the pre-AD phases in an attempt to prevent, 
      delay, and interrupt long-term neurodegenerative processes involved in both normal 
      elderly and depressed elderly conversion to AD. A primary strategy proposed is to 
      delay onset of AD. Population statistics indicate that if AD is delayed by a modest 
      1 year, there would be 9.5 million fewer cases by 2050, resulting in significant 
      reduction in burden of disease. Data show early intervention with cognitive 
      stimulation (mental exercise), physical exercise, aggressive treatment of AD risk 
      factors and excess disability, psychotherapy, and other nonpharmacological 
      interventions in combination with each other and/or with medications can result in 
      delay of onset of AD. First intervention at time of diagnosis of AD is too late, 
      when by definition, final conversion to AD has already occurred. When we have 
      knowledge to successfully intervene earlier, why would we not want to do so.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of a self-management 
      intervention targeting cognitive dysfunction to improve quality of life and reduce 
      memory-related disability in adults with epilepsy. The intervention incorporates (1) 
      education on cognitive function in epilepsy, (2) self-awareness training, (3) 
      compensatory strategies, and (4) application of these strategies in day-to-day life 
      using problem-solving therapy. In addition to the behavioral modification, formal 
      working memory training was conducted by utilizing a commercially available program 
      in a subgroup of patients. Our findings suggest that a self-management intervention 
      targeting cognitive dysfunction was feasible for delivery to a rural population with 
      epilepsy, with 13 of 16 enrolled participants completing the 8-session program. 
      Qualitative data indicate high satisfaction and subjective improvement in cognitive 
      functioning in day-to-day life. These findings provide support for further 
      evaluation of the efficacy of this intervention through a randomized controlled 
      trial.

TI  - Would transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) enhance the effects of working 
      memory training in older adults with mild neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's 
      disease: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been longstanding interesting in cognitive training for older 
      adults with cognitive impairment. In this study, we will investigate the effects of 
      working memory training, and explore augmentation strategies that could possibly 
      consolidate the effects in older adults with mild neurocognitive disorder. 
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been demonstrated to affect the 
      neuronal excitability and reported to enhance memory performance. As tDCS may also 
      modulate cognitive function through changes in neuroplastic response, it would be 
      adopted as an augmentation strategy for working memory training in the present 
      study. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a 4-week intervention double-blind randomized 
      controlled trial (RCT) of tDCS. Chinese older adults (aged 60 to 90 years) with mild 
      neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease (DSM-5 criteria) would be 
      randomized into a 4-week intervention of either tDCS-working memory (DCS-WM), 
      tDCS-control cognitive training (DCS-CC), and sham tDCS-working memory (WM-CD) 
      groups. The primary outcome would be working memory test - the n-back task 
      performance and the Chinese version of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - 
      Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog). Secondary outcomes would be test performance of 
      specific cognitive domains and mood. Intention-to-treat analysis would be carried 
      out. Changes of efficacy indicators with time and intervention would be tested with 
      mixed effect models. DISCUSSION: This study adopts the theory of neuroplasticity to 
      evaluate the potential cognitive benefits of non-invasive electrical brain 
      stimulation, working memory training and dual stimulation in older adults at risk of 
      cognitive decline. It would also examine the tolerability, program adherence and 
      adverse effects of this novel intervention. Information would be helpful for further 
      research of dementia prevention studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ChiCTR-TRC- 14005036

TI  - Unawareness of memory impairment and behavioral abnormalities in patients with 
      Alzheimer's disease: relation to professional health care burden.
PG  - 356-60
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The present study investigates the impact of unawareness of deficit 
      (anosognosia) in patients with Alzheimer's disease upon professional health care 
      burden. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study with a consecutive clinical sample from an 
      Alzheimer day-care hospital in France. SUBJECTS: 65 patients with probable AD, aged 
      from 75 to 94 years old, consecutively admitted at the Alzheimer Day Hospital to 
      complete a program of cognitive stimulation and psychosocial rehabilitation. 
      MEASUREMENTS: Each patient was submitted to a standardized evaluation including 
      clinical investigation, cerebral imagery, and neuropsychological assessment. 
      Anosognosia of memory deficit and anosognosia of behavioral disturbances were 
      measured as the "discrepancy scores" between patients' self-reports and family 
      member ratings of patient memory performance and behavioral disturbances. 
      Professional health care burden was assessed with the Professional Health Care 
      Dementia Burden Index (PCDBI; maximal score: 12), designed for this study. Multiple 
      linear regressions were used to examine the correlations between the PCDBI and the 
      severity of anosognosia. RESULTS: The findings showed a significant positive 
      correlation between the PCDBI and both anosognosia of memory impairment and 
      behavioral abnormalities (both p at least less than 0.05). However, there was no 
      significant correlation between the severity of the burden and the severity of 
      cognitive decline or functional impairment (both p at least>0.05). CONCLUSION: 
      Anosognosia in Alzheimer disease patients has a negative impact upon the 
      professional caregivers' burden over and above the cognitive deficit and the 
      functional impairments.

TI  - Activation and effective connectivity changes following explicit-memory training for 
      face-name pairs in patients with mild cognitive impairment: a pilot study.
PG  - 210-22
LID - 10.1177/1545968310382424 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is often a precursor to Alzheimer 
      disease. Little research has examined the efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation in 
      patients with MCI, and the relevant neural mechanisms have not been explored. The 
      authors previously showed the behavioral efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation using 
      mnemonic strategies for face-name associations in patients with MCI. Here, the 
      authors used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test whether there were 
      training-specific changes in activation and connectivity within memory-related 
      areas. METHODS: A total of 6 patients with amnestic, multidomain MCI underwent 
      pretraining and posttraining fMRI scans, during which they encoded 90 novel 
      face-name pairs and completed a 4-choice recognition memory test immediately after 
      scanning. Patients were taught mnemonic strategies for half the face-name pairs 
      during 3 intervening training sessions. RESULTS: Training-specific effects comprised 
      significantly increased activation within a widespread cerebral cortical network 
      involving medial frontal, parietal, and occipital regions; the left frontal 
      operculum and angular gyrus; and regions in the left lateral temporal cortex. 
      Increased activation common to trained and untrained stimuli was found in a separate 
      network involving inferior frontal, lateral parietal, and occipital cortical 
      regions. Effective connectivity analysis using multivariate, correlation-purged 
      Granger causality analysis revealed generally increased connectivity after training, 
      particularly involving the middle temporal gyrus and foci in the occipital cortex 
      and the precuneus. CONCLUSION: The authors' findings suggest that the effectiveness 
      of explicit-memory training in patients with MCI is associated with 
      training-specific increases in activation and connectivity in a distributed neural 
      system that includes areas involved in explicit memory.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Long Lasting Memories (LLM) program concerns a newly integrated 
      platform which combines cognitive exercises with physical activity within the 
      context of advanced technologies. The main objective of this study was to present 
      the preliminary results that determine the possible effectiveness of the LLM program 
      in the improvement of cognitive functions and symptoms of depression in healthy 
      elderly and subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHOD: Fifty healthy and 
      MCI subjects participated in the study. All of them received one hour's physical 
      training and 35 minutes' cognitive training, 3 times a week, during the 12 weeks of 
      the program. Before and after the intervention all participants were assessed using 
      a battery of neuropsychological tests. RESULTS: The results showed a significant 
      improvement after the LLM training in global cognitive function, in verbal memory, 
      in attention, in episodic memory and symptoms of depression. CONCLUSION: This study 
      indicates that LLM is a promising solution for older adults with and without 
      cognitive impairment, maintaining their wellbeing with few professional and 
      technical requirements.

TI  - Strategies for improving memory: a randomized trial of memory groups for older 
      people, including those with mild cognitive impairment.
PG  - 31-43
LID - 10.3233/JAD-150378 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Governments are promoting the importance of maintaining cognitive health 
      into older age to minimize risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Older people with 
      amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) are particularly vulnerable to memory 
      challenges in daily activities and are seeking ways to maintain independent living. 
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of memory groups for improving memory 
      strategies and memory ability of older people, especially those with aMCI. METHODS: 
      113 healthy older adults (HOA) and 106 adults with aMCI were randomized to a 
      six-week memory group or a waitlist control condition. Outcome was evaluated through 
      knowledge and use of memory strategies, memory ability (self-report and 
      neuropsychological tests), and wellbeing. Assessments included a six-month 
      follow-up. RESULTS: Using intention to treat analyses, there were intervention 
      effects for HOA and aMCI groups in strategy knowledge (HOA: η2= 0.20; aMCI: 
      η2= 0.06), strategy use (HOA: η2= 0.18; aMCI: η2= 0.08), and wellbeing (HOA: 
      η2= 0.11; aMCI: η2= 0.05). There were also intervention effects in the HOA group, 
      but not the aMCI group, in self-reported memory ability (η2= 0.06) and prospective 
      memory tests (η2= 0.02). By six-month follow-up, gains were found on most HOA 
      outcomes. In the aMCI group gains were found in strategy use, and by this stage, 
      gains in prospective memory were also found. CONCLUSION: Memory groups can engage 
      older people in techniques for maintaining cognitive health and improve memory 
      performance, but more modest benefits are seen for older adults with aMCI.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: We sought to identify whether intensive 10-week mobile health mnemonic 
      strategy training (MST) could shift the resting-state brain network more toward 
      cortical-level integration, which has recently been proven to reflect the 
      reorganization of the brain networks compensating the cognitive decline. METHODS: 
      One hundred fifty-eight patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were selected 
      and participated in 10-week training lasting 90 min/d of memory training. They 
      benefited from an initial and a follow-up neuropsychological evaluation and 
      resting-state electroencephalography (EEG). RESULTS: At follow-up, MST revealed an 
      extensive significant training effect that changed the network with an increase of 
      synchronization between parietotemporal and frontal areas; frontal(θ)-parietal(α2) 
      causal strengthening as part of top-down inhibitory control; enhancement of 
      sensorimotor connections in β band; and a general increase of cortical-level 
      integration. More precisely, MST induced gain as an increase of the global cost 
      efficiency (GCE) of the whole cortical network and a neuropsychological performance 
      improvement, which was correlated with it (r = 0.32, P = .0001). The present study 
      unfolded intervention changes based on EEG source activity via novel neuroinformatic 
      tools for revealing intrinsic coupling modes in both amplitude-phase representations 
      and in the mixed spectrospatiotemporal domain. DISCUSSION: Further work should 
      identify whether the GCE enhancement of the functional cortical brain networks is a 
      compensation mechanism to the brain network dysfunction or a more permanent 
      neuroplasticity effect.

TI  - Cognitive stimulation in cognitively impaired individuals and cognitively healthy 
      individuals with a family history of dementia: short-term results from the 
      "Allena-Mente" randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 631-8
LID - 10.1002/gps.4194 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the short-term efficacy of a protocol of cognitive 
      stimulation (CS), compared with a sham intervention, on cognitive performance in 
      cognitively healthy individuals with a family history of dementia (NDFAM) and in 
      non-demented individuals with cognitive impairment (CI). METHODS: We performed a 
      randomized controlled trial of CS in NDFAM and CI. CS consisted in 10 twice weekly 
      meetings of CS focused on a specific cognitive area. CS was compared with a sham 
      intervention (CT) using Mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive 
      Assessment (MoCA), and the Corsi test. All study participants were typed for the 
      presence of apolipoprotein E (APOE)-Ɛ4. RESULTS: Cognitively healthy NDFAM showed a 
      higher net cognitive gain after CS, as reflected in their MoCA score, and a 
      borderline significant net increase in visuospatial memory (Corsi test) compared 
      with those receiving the CT. APOE-Ɛ4 carriers showed a less significant improvement 
      on the Corsi test with respect to APOE-Ɛ4 non-carriers. In the CI sample, the MoCA 
      and Corsi test results did not differ between the cognitively stimulated subjects 
      and the controls. No changes in MMSE scores were found in either sample of subjects. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that CS as structured in this study is an 
      effective treatment in cognitively healthy individuals, whereas it is less effective 
      in individuals with CI. Moreover, evaluation of APOE-Ɛ4 status provided evidence of 
      a substantial genetic contribution to the efficacy of CS on visuospatial memory as 
      measured using the Corsi test.

TI  - A complex multimodal activity intervention to reduce the risk of dementia in mild 
      cognitive impairment--ThinkingFit: pilot and feasibility study for a randomized 
      controlled trial.
PG  - 129
LID - 10.1186/1471-244X-14-129 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dementia affects 35 million people worldwide and is currently incurable. 
      Many cases may be preventable because regular participation in physical, mental and 
      social leisure activities during middle age is associated with up to 47% dementia 
      risk reduction. However, the majority of middle-aged adults are not active enough. 
      MCI is therefore a clear target for activity interventions aimed at reducing 
      dementia risk. An active lifestyle during middle age reduces dementia risk but it 
      remains to be determined if increased activity reduces dementia risk when MCI is 
      already evident. Before this can be investigated conclusively, complex multimodal 
      activity programmes are required that (1) combine multiple health promoting 
      activities, (2) engage people with MCI, and (3) result in sufficient adherence 
      rates. METHODS: We designed the ThinkingFit programme to engage people with MCI in a 
      complex intervention comprised of three activity components: physical activity, 
      group-based cognitive stimulation (GCST) and individual cognitive stimulation 
      (ICST). Engagement and adherence was promoted by applying specific psychological 
      techniques to enhance behavioural flexibility in an early pre-phase and during the 
      course of the intervention. To pilot the intervention, participants served as their 
      own controls during a 6- to 12-week run-in period, which was followed by 12 weeks of 
      activity intervention. RESULTS: Out of 212 MCI patients screened, 163 were eligible, 
      70 consented and 67 completed the intervention (mean age 74 years). Activity 
      adherence rates were high: physical activity = 71%; GCST = 83%; ICST = 67%. 
      Significant treatment effects (p < .05) were evident on physical health outcomes 
      (decreased BMI and systolic blood pressure, [pre/post values of 26.3/25.9 kg/m2 and 
      145/136 mmHg respectively]), fitness (decreased resting and recovery heart rate 
      [68/65 bpm and 75/69 bpm]), and cognition (improved working memory [5.3/6.3 items]). 
      CONCLUSIONS: We found satisfactory recruitment, retention and engagement rates, 
      coupled with significant treatment effects in elderly MCI patients. It appears 
      feasible to conduct randomized controlled trials of the dementia prevention 
      potential of complex multimodal activity programmes like ThinkingFit. TRIAL

TI  - Effects of lexical-semantic treatment on memory in early Alzheimer disease: an 
      observer-blinded randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 949-56
LID - 10.1177/1545968312440146 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Episodic memory and semantic abilities deteriorate early in Alzheimer 
      disease (AD). Since the cognitive system includes interconnected and reciprocally 
      influenced neuronal networks, the authors hypothesized that stimulation of 
      lexical-semantic abilities may benefit semantically structured episodic memory. 
      OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of lexical-semantic stimulation (LSS) on 
      verbal communication and episodic memory in early AD. METHODS: Forty AD participants 
      were randomized to LSS or unstructured cognitive stimulation (UCS) as control 
      condition. Treatments lasted 3 months, 2 sections a week. The primary outcome 
      measures were the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Boston Naming Test (BNT), 
      Verbal Naming Test (VNT), Phonemic and Semantic Fluency, Story Recall, and Rey 
      Auditory Verbal Learning (RAVL). Secondary outcome measures were neuropsychological 
      tests assessing cognitive functions not stimulated by the intervention, such as 
      attention, executive functions, and visual-spatial abilities, and the instrumental 
      activities of daily living scale. A 6-month follow-up assessment was administered to 
      the LSS group. RESULTS: LSS treatment yielded significant improvements of the MMSE, 
      BNT, VNT, Brief Story Recall, and RAVL delayed recall mean scores. Among secondary 
      outcome measures, only working memory and the speed of a task assessing executive 
      functions (Stroop test) improved after LSS. Unstructured cognitive stimulation 
      intervention did not improve any cognitive domain. Six months after LSS 
      discontinuation, the MMSE mean score remains significantly higher than the baseline 
      value. CONCLUSION: LSS treatment may improve episodic memory in AD patients and may 
      be regarded as a clinical option to counteract the cognitive decline typical of the 
      disease.

TI  - Robotic agents for supporting community-dwelling elderly people with memory 
      complaints: Perceived needs and preferences.
PG  - 33-40

AB  - Researchers in robotics have been increasingly focusing on robots as a means of 
      supporting older people with cognitive impairment at home. The aim of this study is 
      to explore the elderly's needs and preferences towards having an assistive robot in 
      the home. In order to ensure the appropriateness of this technology, 30 subjects 
      aged 60 and older with memory complaints were recruited from the Memory Clinic of 
      the Broca Hospital. We conducted an interview-administered questionnaire that 
      included questions about their needs and preferences concerning robot functions and 
      modes of action. The subjects reported a desire to retain their capacity to manage 
      their daily activities, to maintain good health and to stimulate their memory. 
      Regarding robot functions, the cognitive stimulation programme earned the highest 
      proportion of positive responses, followed by the safeguarding functions, fall 
      detection and the automatic help call.

TI  - MAPT STUDY: A MULTIDOMAIN APPROACH FOR PREVENTING ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE: DESIGN AND 
      BASELINE DATA.
PG  - 13-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT study) was designed to 
      assess the efficacy of isolated supplementation with omega-3 fatty acid, an isolated 
      multidomain intervention (consisting of nutritional counseling, physical exercise, 
      cognitive stimulation) or a combination of the two interventions on the change of 
      cognitive functions in frail subjects aged 70 years and older for a period of 3 
      years. Ancillary neuroimaging studies were additionally implemented to evaluate the 
      impact of interventions on cerebral metabolism (FDG PET scans) and atrophy rate 
      (MRIs), as well as brain amyloïd deposit (AV45 PET scans). DESIGN PATIENTS: 1680 
      subjects (mean age: 75.3 years; female: 64.8 %), enrolled by 13 memory clinics, were 
      randomized into one of the following four groups: omega-3 supplementation alone, 
      multidomain intervention alone, omega-3 plus multidomain intervention, or placebo. 
      Participants underwent cognitive, functional and biological assessments at M6, M12, 
      M24 and M36 visits. The primary endpoint is a change of memory function at 3 years, 
      as assessed by the Free and Cued Selective Reminding test. All participants will be 
      followed for 2 additional years after the 3-years intervention (MAPT PLUS extension 
      study). INTERVENTIONS: 1/Omega-3 supplementation: two soft capsules daily as a 
      single dose, containing a total of 400 mg docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), i.e., 800 mg 
      docosahexaenoic acid per day, for 3 years. 2/ Multidomain intervention: collective 
      training sessions conducted in small groups (6-8 participants) in twelve 120-minute 
      sessions over the first 2 months (two sessions a week for the first month, and one 
      session a week the second month) then a 60-minute session per month in the following 
      three areas: nutrition, physical activity, and cognition until the end of the 3 
      years. In addition to the collective sessions, individualized preventive outpatient 
      visits exploring possible risk factors for cognitive decline are performed at 
      baseline, M12 and M24. BASELINE POPULATION: For cognition, the mean MMSE at baseline 
      was 28.1 (± 1.6). About 58% and 42% of participants had a CDR score equal to 0 and 
      0.5, respectively. Regarding mobility status, 200 (11.9%) had a 4-m gait speed lower 
      or equal to 0.8 m/s. According to the Fried criteria, 673 (42.1%) participants were 
      considered pre frail, and 51 (3.2%) frail. The red blood cell DHA content was 26.1 ± 
      8.1 µg/g. Five hundred and three participants underwent baseline MRI. AV45 PET scans 
      were performed in 271 individuals and preliminary results showed that 38.0% had a 
      cortical SUVR > 1.17, which gave an indication of significant brain amyloïd deposit. 
      DISCUSSION: The MAPT trial is presently the first largest and longest multidomain 
      preventive trial relevant to cognitive decline in older adults with subjective 
      memory complaints. The multidomain intervention designed for the MAPT trial is 
      likely to be easily implemented within the general population.

AB  - Cognitive decline in aging is a pressing issue associated with significant 
      healthcare costs and deterioration in quality of life. Previously, we reported the 
      successful use of a novel brain-computer interface (BCI) training system in 
      improving symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Here, we examine the 
      feasibility of the BCI system with a new game that incorporates memory training in 
      improving memory and attention in a pilot sample of healthy elderly. This study 
      investigates the safety, usability and acceptability of our BCI system to elderly, 
      and obtains an efficacy estimate to warrant a phase III trial. Thirty-one healthy 
      elderly were randomized into intervention (n = 15) and waitlist control arms 
      (n = 16). Intervention consisted of an 8-week training comprising 24 half-hour 
      sessions. A usability and acceptability questionnaire was administered at the end of 
      training. Safety was investigated by querying users about adverse events after every 
      session. Efficacy of the system was measured by the change of total score from the 
      Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) before 
      and after training. Feedback on the usability and acceptability questionnaire was 
      positive. No adverse events were reported for all participants across all sessions. 
      Though the median difference in the RBANS change scores between arms was not 
      statistically significant, an effect size of 0.6SD was obtained, which reflects 
      potential clinical utility according to Simon's randomized phase II trial design. 
      Pooled data from both arms also showed that the median change in total scores pre 
      and post-training was statistically significant (Mdn = 4.0; p<0.001). Specifically, 
      there were significant improvements in immediate memory (p = 0.038), 
      visuospatial/constructional (p = 0.014), attention (p = 0.039), and delayed memory 
      (p<0.001) scores. Our BCI-based system shows promise in improving memory and 
      attention in healthy elderly, and appears to be safe, user-friendly and acceptable 
      to senior users. Given the efficacy signal, a phase III trial is warranted. TRIAL

LID - 10.1111/psyg.12056 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of memory complaints on 
      quality of life (QOL) in elderly community dwellers with or without mild cognitive 
      impairment (MCI). METHODS: Participants included 120 normal controls (NC) and 37 
      with MCI aged 65 and over. QOL was measured using the Japanese version of 
      Satisfaction in Daily Life, and memory complaints were measured using a 
      questionnaire consisting of four items. The relevance of QOL was evaluated with 
      psychological factors of personality traits, sense of self-efficacy, depressive 
      mood, self-evaluation of daily functioning, range of social activities (Life-Space 
      Assessment), social network size, and cognitive functions including memory. The 
      predictors of QOL were analyzed by multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: QOL 
      was not significantly different between the NC and MCI groups. In both groups, QOL 
      was positively correlated with self-efficacy, daily functioning, social network 
      size, Life-Space Assessment, and the personality traits of extraversion and 
      agreeableness; QOL was negatively correlated with memory complaints, depressive 
      mood, and the personality trait of neuroticism. In regression analysis, memory 
      complaints were a negative predictor of QOL in the MCI group, but not in the NC 
      group. The partial correlation coefficient between QOL and memory complaints was 
      -0.623 (P < 0.05), after scores of depressive mood and self-efficacy were 
      controlled. Depressive mood was a common negative predictor in both groups. Positive 
      predictors were Life-Space Assessment in the NC group and sense of self-efficacy in 
      the MCI group. CONCLUSIONS: Memory complaints exerted a negative impact on 
      self-rated QOL in the MCI group, whereas a negative correlation was weak in the NC 
      group. Memory training has been widely practised in individuals with MCI to prevent 
      the development of dementia. However, such approaches inevitably identify their 
      memory deficits and could aggravate their awareness of memory decline. Thus, it is 
      critical to give sufficient consideration not to reduce QOL in the intervention for 
      those with MCI.

TI  - Does cognitive training improve attention/working memory in persons with MS? A pilot 
      study using the Cogmed Working Memory Training program.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive deficits, especially in attention, are common in persons with 
      MS (PwMS) and are associated with clinically meaningful outcomes, such as work 
      disability and lower quality of life (QOL). In this study, we aimed to determine 
      whether Cogmed Working Memory Training (CWMT) improves attention/working memory in 
      PwMS displaying impairment in these domains. METHODS: This single blind, randomized 
      controlled, pilot study compared the effects of CWMT, a five-week evidenced-based 
      computer-assisted training program that is supported by weekly meetings with a 
      coach, to standard medical care (treatment as usual). We recruited PwMS from one MS 
      center (London (ON) Canada), aged 18-64, with an Expanded Disability Status Scale 
      (EDSS) score of ≤ 7.0, and a visual acuity (corrected) of at least 20/70. Potential 
      subjects had to demonstrate impaired attention on at least two of three measures 
      (Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test [PASAT], Symbol Digit Modalities Test [SDMT], 
      and/or DKEFS Color-Word Interference Test); these measures also served as the 
      primary study outcomes. Subjects were randomized to either the CWMT or treatment as 
      usual. Secondary cognitive outcomes included other measures of attention, memory, as 
      well as a self-reported cognitive function measure. Self-reported measures of mood 
      (depression and anxiety), pain, and QOL were also included as other secondary 
      outcomes. Subjects received assessments at baseline, post-treatment, and 6-month 
      follow-up, or an equivalent time period for the treatment as usual group. The two 
      groups were compared at baseline on background measures using independent samples 
      t-tests, Chi-Square tests, and Mann-Whitney U tests. To analyze primary and 
      secondary outcomes, a non-parametric approach was used due the small sample size and 
      that many of our outcomes did not meet assumptions for parametric analyses. 
      Friedman's test was conducted followed by post hoc pairwise comparisons within each 
      group using Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests with Bonferroni corrected post hoc contrasts, 
      which allowed us to examine for differences between time points. RESULTS: Of 30 
      subjects, 15 were assigned to CWMT. Significant training effects were noted in 1 of 
      3 primary attentional outcomes (DKEFS Color-Word Interference Test), 2 of 3 
      secondary attentional outcomes (Letter-Number Sequencing, Digit Span), and 1 mood 
      scale (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) - Depression Subscale), ps < 
      .025. No significant changes were observed in the treatment as usual group. 
      CONCLUSION: This pilot study demonstrates that cognitive training with CWMT has the 
      potential to improve attention/working memory in PwMS, as well as a potential 
      positive effect on mood, in PwMS. Further exploration of this intervention in PwMS 
      with attention/working memory impairment is warranted.

TI  - Evaluation of a computer-assisted errorless learning-based memory training program 
      for patients with early Alzheimer's disease in Hong Kong: a pilot study.
PG  - 623-33
LID - 10.2147/CIA.S45726 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Improving the situation in older adults with cognitive decline and 
      evidence of cognitive rehabilitation is considered crucial in long-term care of the 
      elderly. The objective of this study was to implement a computerized errorless 
      learning-based memory training program (CELP) for persons with early Alzheimer's 
      disease, and to compare the training outcomes of a CELP group with those of a 
      therapist-led errorless learning program (TELP) group and a waiting-list control 
      group. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial with a single-blind research design 
      was used in the study. Chinese patients with early Alzheimer's disease screened by 
      the Clinical Dementia Rating (score of 1) were recruited. The subjects were randomly 
      assigned to CELP (n = 6), TELP (n = 6), and waiting-list control (n = 7) groups. 
      Evaluation of subjects before and after testing, and at three-month follow-up was 
      achieved using primary outcomes on the Chinese Mini-Mental State Examination, 
      Chinese Dementia Rating Scale, Hong Kong List Learning Test, and the Brief 
      Assessment of Prospective Memory-Short Form. Secondary outcomes were the Modified 
      Barthel Index, Hong Kong Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, and 
      Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form. The data were analyzed using Friedman's test 
      for time effect and the Kruskal-Wallis test for treatment effect. RESULTS: Positive 
      treatment effects on cognition were found in two errorless learning-based memory 
      groups (ie, computer-assisted and therapist-led). Remarkable changes were shown in 
      cognitive function for subjects receiving CELP and emotional/daily functions in 
      those receiving TELP. CONCLUSION: Positive changes in the cognitive function of 
      Chinese patients with early Alzheimer's disease were initially found after errorless 
      training through CELP. Further enhancement of the training program is recommended.

TI  - FDG-PET in the Evaluation of Brain Metabolic Changes Induced by Cognitive 
      Stimulation in aMCI Subjects.
PG  - 69-75
AB  - Cognitive training has reported to improve cognitive performance in Mild Cognitive 
      Impairment (MCI) as well as in older healthy subjects. 18F-FDG-PET is widely used in 
      the diagnoses of dementia for its ability to identify early metabolic changes. This 
      study was aimed to assess the effect of cognitive stimulation on brain metabolic 
      network and clinical cognitive performance. Thirty aMCI subjects were enrolled in 
      the study and allocated in two groups matched for cognitive profile, sex and 
      schooling and then randomly assigned to the training arm or to the placebo arm. All 
      subjects underwent neuropsychological assessment and PET imaging before and after 
      intervention. We found significant association between brain metabolism and 
      cognitive stimulation in treated aMCI subjects. Brain metabolic changes included 
      Brodmann areas reported to be involved in working memory and attentive processes as 
      well as executive functions. Our study shows that metabolic changes occur earlier 
      than possible clinical changes related to the intervention. 18F-FDG-PET could 
      provide a useful biomarker of response to identify a population of aMCI suitable to 
      respond to treatment, according to most recent data on default network mode and its 
      adaptivity to external stimuli.

TI  - Partnership and Cognitive Aging in Europe: Mediating Factors and Social 
      Stratification.
LID - gbab020 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/geronb/gbab020 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Living in a partnership has been shown to benefit later life health in 
      general and decrease the risk of cognitive impairment. Few studies have, however, 
      examined whether different types of partnership transitions also differ with respect 
      to their impact on cognitive trajectories, and whether financial resources, health 
      behaviors, cognitive stimulation and social integration can explain these 
      differences. METHODS: Data came from six waves of the Survey of Health, Ageing and 
      Retirement in Europe, which is a representative panel for the population aged 50 
      years or older, and was collected between 2004 and 2017 in 20 European countries. 
      Our sample includes 215,989 valid person-year observations from 78,984 persons. Mean 
      age at baseline is 64 years, and individuals were observed on average 2.7 times. 
      Cognitive functioning was assessed with measures of immediate and delayed recall on 
      a memory test, and verbal fluency. Fixed-effects regression models were employed to 
      exploit individual-level variation in partnership and simultaneous cognitive 
      changes. RESULTS: Partnership status was stable in most respondents (around 90%). 
      Compared to remaining partnered and after controlling for socio-demographic factors, 
      transition to divorce was associated with a steeper decline in immediate and delayed 
      recall. Exploring possible mechanisms, both financial resources and social 
      integration explained these differences. Additional analyses suggested that effects 
      were mostly driven by individuals with lower education. DISCUSSION: Partnership 
      transitions remain infrequent events in later life, but our findings indicate that 
      they can induce less favorable cognitive trajectories compared to partnered 
      individuals, particularly for those with lower cognitive reserve.

TI  - The effectiveness of artificial intelligent 3-D virtual reality vocational 
      problem-solving training in enhancing employment opportunities for people with 
      traumatic brain injury.
PG  - 1016-25
LID - 10.3109/02699052.2013.794969 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: People with traumatic brain injury (TBI) often experience cognitive 
      deficits in attention, memory, executive functioning and problem-solving. The 
      purpose of the present research study was to examine the effectiveness of an 
      artificial intelligent virtual reality (VR)-based vocational problem-solving skill 
      training programme designed to enhance employment opportunities for people with TBI. 
      METHOD: This was a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the 
      effectiveness of the above programme with that of the conventional 
      psycho-educational approach. Forty participants with mild (n = 20) or moderate 
      (n = 20) brain injury were randomly assigned to each training programme. Comparisons 
      of problem-solving skills were performed with the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, the 
      Tower of London Test and the Vocational Cognitive Rating Scale. RESULTS: Improvement 
      in selective memory processes and perception of memory function were found. 
      Across-group comparison showed that the VR group performed more favourably than the 
      therapist-led one in terms of objective and subjective outcome measures and better 
      vocational outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the potential use of a 
      VR-based approach in memory training in people with MCI. Further VR applications, 
      limitations and future research are described.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide evidence about the efficacy of a community health intervention 
      through a cognitive stimulation program at long term in older people with mild 
      cognitive impairment. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial (CONSORT group norms). 
      LOCATION: San José Norte-Centro Primary Care Center and La Caridad Foundation 
      (Zaragoza, Spain). PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-nine people over 65 years old with a 24-27 
      MEC score that completed 48 months follow up. They were randomized between the 
      intervention group (15) and the control group (14). INTERVENTIONS: The intervention 
      was applied in 10 sessions of 45min for 10 weeks using the red notebook tool for 
      mental activation that works memory, orientation, language, praxis, gnosis, 
      calculation, perception, logical reasoning, attention and executive functions. MAIN 
      MEASUREMENTS: The main outcome variables were MEC-35, Set-test, Barthel index, 
      Lawton-Brody scale, Goldberg anxiety scale and Yesavage geriatric depression scale 
      short form. RESULTS: Increases of the main result variable over the baseline level 
      of MEC-35 were analyzed. On average, the intervention group obtained higher scores 
      than control: 3.14 points post intervention, 3.76 points after 6 months and 2.26 
      points more than control group after 12 months. All the differences were 
      statistically significant. After 48 months the intervention group obtained 2 points 
      more than control group. The intervention did not improve verbal fluency, activity 
      daily living and mood. CONCLUSIONS: Our cognitive stimulation program seems to 
      improve cognitive performance, measured with the variable MEC-35 at post 
      intervention, 6, 12 and 48 months. There is no evidence of improvement in verbal 
      fluency, activity daily livings and mood. Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: 
      NCT03831061.

TI  - Dual-Task Exercise to Improve Cognition and Functional Capacity of Healthy Older 
      Adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that physical inactivity and lack of stimulating 
      cognitive activity are the two most significant modifiable risk factors to impair 
      cognitive function. Although many studies that investigated the cognitive effects of 
      physical exercise and cognitive stimuli in dual-task conditions showed improved 
      cognitive performance, others have not confirmed these findings. The main aim of the 
      present work is to analyze the effects of a dual-task multimodal physical exercise 
      training, at moderate intensity, and cognitive stimulation on cognitive and physical 
      function in healthy older adults. METHODS: This clinical trial was registered on the 
      Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (RBR-9zrx3d). Here we tested the effects of a 
      dual-task multimodal physical exercise training, at moderate intensity, on cognitive 
      and physical function and quality of life in community dwelling older adults. The 
      training protocol included 24 group sessions, 2/week, per 75 min. Cognition was 
      assessed using CANTAB automated neuropsychological tests and Functional Capacity to 
      Exercise tests. Performance was compared from baseline to post intervention and to a 
      non-exercise control group using Mixed Linear Model for repeated measures. RESULTS: 
      Control (CG) and dual-task (DTEx) groups progressed differentially over time on 
      performance of episodic memory, sustained visual attention, functional mobility, 
      cardiorespiratory fitness, lower limbs strength resistance, agility, quality of life 
      and dual-task performance with significant improved DTEx performance. Control group 
      did not show any significant changes on these tests except for showing a reduction 
      in dual-task performance. CONCLUSION: We suggest that the dual-task combination of 
      multisensory cognitive stimulation and multimodal moderate physical exercise 
      training, twice a week, may be adopted as an effective program to reduce progression 
      of age-related cognitive decline and improve physical fitness and quality of life on 
      healthy older adults. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Brazilian Registry of Clinical
