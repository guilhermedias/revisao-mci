TI  - Working memory training in normal and pathological aging: neurocognitive gains and generalization
T2  - GERIATRIE ET PSYCHOLOGIE NEUROPSYCHIATRIE DE VIEILLISSEMENT
AB  - Working memory is one of the cognitive functions that is the most sensitive to normal and pathological age-related effects. In older individuals with a mild cognitive impairment, deficits in working memory are frequent and can precede those of episodic memory, in addition to having a strong prognostic value of evolution toward a dementia of Alzheimer type. Because of its implication in numerous cognitive and cognitive-motor tasks, working memory is called upon in a wide range of daily life activities. Impairment in working memory therefore increases the risk of a loss of autonomy. In the current review, we present different working memory training programs. We show how these training programs are associated with specific effects and to near and far transfers towards other cognitive functions in older adults without cognitive impairment or with mild cognitive impairment, as well as in patients with dementia. We show that the benefits are confirmed by neuronal modifications, suggesting an improvement in the neuronal efficiency of the targeted or related trained processes. Finally, we consider the central question of the generalization of the cognitive gains of working memory training toward ecological situations.

TI  - Development and effectiveness of virtual interactive working memory training for older people with mild cognitive impairment: a single-blind randomised controlled trial
T2  - AGE AND AGEING
AB  - Background: memory training is a potential intervention for retaining memory and reducing dementia risk in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
   Objective: this study examined the effect of virtual interactive working memory training (VIMT) in older adults with MCI.
   Design: single-blind, two-arm parallel-group, randomised controlled design.
   Setting: retirement homes, institutions, and communities.
   Subjects: a total of 66 older adults with MCI were recruited (mean age: 78.5 +/- 7.6 years).
   Methods: participants were randomly assigned to the experimental group (VIMT, n = 33) or active control group (n = 33). The VIMT program used the CogniPlus (includes four training modules). Both groups attended 45 min sessions 3 times per week, a total of 36 sessions. The primary outcome was working memory; secondary outcomes were immediate memory, delayed memory, subjective memory complaints and global cognitive function. All variables were measured at pre-test, post-test, and 3-month follow-up.
   Results: between group, the effect of working memory adjusted mean difference by 1.75 (95% CI: 0.56 to 2.94; P < 0.01) at post-test. The results were analysed by a generalised estimating equation, which indicated that VIMT group significantly improved working memory at post-test (P = 0.01) relative to the active control group.
   Conclusions: the applied VIMT program can enable older adults with MCI to maintain their working memory and reduce the rate of cognitive deterioration.

TI  - Adaptive Computerized Working Memory Training in Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment. A Randomized Double-Blind Active Controlled Trial
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Objective: We investigated if a 5-week computerized adaptive working memory training program (CogmedR (R)) of 20 to 25 sessions would be effective in improving the working memory capacity and other neuropsychological functions compared to a non-adaptive working memory training program (active-controlled) in adult patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
   Methods: This randomized double-blinded active control trial included 68 individuals aged 43 to 88 years, 45 men and 23 women, who were diagnosed with MCI at four Memory clinics. The study sample was randomized by block randomization to either adaptive or non-adaptive computerized working memory training. All participants completed the training, and were assessed with a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery before the intervention, and at 1 and 4 months after training.
   Results: Compared to the non-adaptive training group, the adaptive training group did not show significantly greater improvement on the main outcome of working memory performance at 1 and 4 months after training.
   Conclusion: No difference were found between the two types of training on the primary outcome of working memory, or on secondary outcomes of cognitive function domains, in this sample of MCI patients. Hence, the hypothesis that the adaptive training program would lead to greater improvements compared to the non-adaptive training program was not supported. Within group analyses was not performed due to the stringent RCT design.

TI  - Memory training for adults with probable mild cognitive impairment: a pilot study
T2  - AGING & MENTAL HEALTH
AB  - Background & Objectives: This pilot study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of memory training and health training intervention over a 24-month period in people with probable mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Research Design & Methods: Based on the accepted criteria, and the neuropsychiatric measures used in the trial, MCI was defined as a subjective change in cognition, impairment in episodic memory, preservation of independence of functional abilities, and no dementia. Without a neurological assessment, laboratory tests, and psychometric evaluation combined, some of our participants may have had dementia that we were unable to detect through neuropsychological testing. Of the 263 total participants, 39 met criteria for a diagnosis of MCI. There were 19 adults in the memory and 20 in health training conditions. Both groups received twenty hours of classroom content that included eight hours of booster sessions at three months post intervention. Hierarchical linear models (HLM) and standardized regression-based (SBR) analyses were used to test the efficacy of the intervention on immediate recall, delayed recall, subjective memory complaints, and memory self-efficacy. Age, education, depression, racial group, ethnic group, MMSE score, and baseline performance were included as covariates. Results: Over 24 months, the MCI group in the memory training condition showed better objective and subjective memory outcomes compared with the MCI group in the health training condition. Conclusions: Senior WISE Memory training delivered to individuals with MCI was able to forestall the participants' declining cognitive ability and sustain the benefit over two years in both subjective and objective memory function.

TI  - Transfer and maintenance effects of online working-memory training in normal ageing and mild cognitive impairment
T2  - NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION
AB  - Working memory (WM) is one of the cognitive functions that is susceptible to ageing-related decline. Interventions that are able to improve WM functioning at older age are thus highly relevant. In this pilot study, we explored the transfer effects of core WM training on the WM domain and other cognitive domains in 23 healthy older adults and 18 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Performance on neuropsychological tests was assessed before and after completion of the online five-week adaptive WM training, and after a three-month follow-up period. After training, both groups improved on the Digit Span and Spatial Span, gains that were maintained at follow-up. At an individual level, a limited number of participants showed reliable training gain. Healthy older adults, and to a lesser extent MCI patients, additionally improved on figural fluency at group level, but not at individual level. Results furthermore showed that global brain atrophy and hippocampal atrophy, as assessed by MRI, may negatively affect training outcome. Our study examined core WM training, showing gains on trained and untrained tasks within the WM domain, but no broad generalisation to other cognitive domains. More research is needed to evaluate the clinical relevance of these findings and to identify participant characteristics that are predictive of training gain.

TI  - Working Memory Training in Amnestic and Non-amnestic Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment: Preliminary Findings From Genotype Variants on Training Effects
T2  - FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Working memory training (WMT) effects may be modulated by mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subtypes, and variations in APOE-epsilon (APOE-epsilon) and LMX1A genotypes. Sixty-one individuals (41 men/20 women, mean age 66 years) diagnosed with MCI (31 amnestic/30 non-amnestic) and genotyped for APOE-epsilon and LMX1A completed 4 weeks/20-25 sessions of WMT. Cognitive functions were assessed before, 4 weeks and 16 weeks after WMT. Except for Processing Speed, the non-amnestic MCI group (naMCI) outperformed the amnestic MCI (aMCI) group in all cognitive domains across all time-points. At 4 weeks, working memory function improved in both groups (p < 0.0001), but at 16 weeks the effects only remained in the naMCI group. Better performance was found after training for the naMCI patients with LMX1A-AA genotype and for the APOE-epsilon 4 carriers. Only the naMCI-APOE-epsilon 4 group showed improved Executive Function at 16 weeks. WMT improved working memory and some non-trained cognitive functions in individuals with MCI. The naMCI group had greater training gain than aMCI group, especially in those with LMX1A-AA genotype and among APOE-epsilon 4-carriers. Further research with larger sample sizes for the subgroups and longer follow-up evaluations is warranted.

TI  - Subjective memory complaints in Italian elderly with mild cognitive impairment: implication of psychological status
T2  - NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Subjective cognitive and memory complaints (SMC) are common in later life and are considered an indicator for progression to cognitive decline. The aim of the present study was to identify the relationship among SMC, neuropsychiatric symptoms and psychological aspects in elderly subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as well as to analyse the effect on SMC of a comprehensive cognitive training. Data from a sample of 94 patients enrolled in 'My Mind Project' (Grant No. 154/GR-2009-1584108) were collected. The study evidenced that depression was a significant predictor of SMC and that after the training, the number of subjects with SMC was significantly reduced in the experimental group in comparison to the control one. These results suggest that the participation in cognitive stimulation protocols may improve the perception of SMC in subjects with MCI.

TI  - Characterizing magnitude and selectivity of attrition in a study of mild cognitive impairment
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUTRITION HEALTH & AGING
AB  - Attrition is one of the greatest difficulties in longitudinal studies on cognitive ageing because of the associated risk of underestimating declines. The aims of this paper were to characterize the magnitude and selectivity of attrition in a study of mild cognitive impairment.
   Forty two patients with multiple-domain amnestic MCI, 71 with single-domain amnestic MCI, 35 with non-amnestic MCI and 318 healthy controls were recruited from primary care centers and assessed at baseline.
   All participants underwent extensive neuropsychological evaluation, including the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Californian Verbal Learning Test, the CAMCOG-R battery, the Counting Span task and Listening Span task, and the Subjective Memory Complaints Questionnaire.
   21.5% of the participants at baseline did not participate in the follow-up assessment. Comparison between respondents and non-returners did not reveal differences in cognitive performance in the MCI group. Data obtained at the initial assessment regarding comorbidity, social activities and attention given to memory training enabled prediction of the status of the participants in the follow-up assessment.
   Identification of potential non- returners is relevant, especially in MCI studies, in order to develop retention strategies to minimize attrition.

TI  - The Efficacy of Cognitive Stimulation on Depression and Cognition in Elderly Patients with Cognitive Impairment: A Retrospective Cohort Study
T2  - AIMS MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Cognitive decline due to neurodegenerative diseases is a prevalent worldwide problem. Both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments to improve, delay or stop disease progression are of vital importance. Cognitive stimulation is frequently used in clinical practice; however, there are few studies that demonstrate its efficacy. Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of cognitive stimulation in patients with mild cognitive impairment (CDR = 0.5) and dementia (CDR = 1). Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed. Patients with cognitive impairment receiving weekly cognitive stimulation (16 or 24 sessions) were evaluated with a complete neuropsychological battery before and after the stimulation program. Each stimulation session was carried out by a trained neuropsychologist. Results: Forty two patients receiving cognitive stimulation were evaluated over a period of 12.53 months (SD 5.5). Patients were grouped as 11 amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), 23 multi domain mild cognitive impairment (mMCI) and 8 Mild Alzheimer's Dementia (CDR 1). None of the groups improved their cognitive functions after the cognitive stimulation program. MCI group was also divided according to their global intelligence quotient (IQ) into two groups: low (IQ < 98.5) and high (IQ > 98.5). Each group was compared before and after the stimulation program and no significant difference was found (p >= 0.05). Moreover, MCI group was also analyzed according to the duration of the stimulation program: less than 9, between 9 and 13 and more than 13 months. Different duration groups were compared before and after the cognitive stimulation program and no significant differences were found. Depression, anxiety and subjective memory symptoms were also analysed and neither improvement nor worsening could be demonstrated. Conclusions: Patients remained stable, both in cognitive and behavioural domains, for more than 18 months. However, no significant cognitive or behavioural improvement can be reported in these patients after the stimulation program (duration time: 12.53 months SD 5.5).

TI  - Ketogenic diet, high intensity interval training (HIIT) and memory training in the treatment of mild cognitive impairment: A case study
T2  - DIABETES & METABOLIC SYNDROME-CLINICAL RESEARCH & REVIEWS
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) deaths have increased by 89% since 2000. This alarming trajectory of neurological disease highlights the failure of current best practice. Deteriorating brain fuel supply is the nemesis of intact neurological health. Cerebral hypo-metabolism associated with AD occurs years before onset. Both the ketogenic diet and calorie restriction (fasting) lead to a compensatory rise in ketones to improve energy deficits in the brain derived from cerebral insulin resistance. Two forms of ketone bodies, beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, fuel the brain during starvation, fasting and strenuous exercise. Ketones are neuroprotective agents that shelter the aging brain from memory loss and neurodegeneration. Induced ketone production has been shown to ameliorate mitochondrial function, reduce the expression of apoptotic and inflammatory mediators and provide neuroprotection to cells (Lange et al., 2017). This case study highlights an innovative research design aimed at attenuating memory decline in a 57 year old female previously diagnosed with comorbid mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and metabolic syndrome (MetS). Mild cognitive impairment is a predementia syndrome known to precede AD (Michaud et al, 2017). The 12-week intervention included ketogenic nutrition protocol, high intensity interval training (HIIT) and memory training using the PEAK brain training app. Memory function was assessed via the MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) pre/post intervention. Physiological biomarkers for MetS including HOMA-IR(homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance), triglyceride/HDL ratio, HgA1c, fasting triglycerides and HDL were measured pre/post intervention. MoCA baseline score was 22/30 (MCI); post intervention score: 30/30 (normal). MetS biomarker improvements also reflected statistical significance. (C) 2018 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Prefrontal activation may predict working-memory training gain in normal aging and mild cognitive impairment
T2  - BRAIN IMAGING AND BEHAVIOR
AB  - Cognitive training has been shown to result in improved behavioral performance in normal aging and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), yet little is known about the neural correlates of cognitive plasticity, or about individual differences in responsiveness to cognitive training. In this study, 21 healthy older adults and 14 patients with MCI received five weeks of adaptive computerized working-memory (WM) training. Before and after training, functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to assess the hemodynamic response in left and right prefrontal cortex during performance of a verbal n-back task with varying levels of WM load. After training, healthy older adults demonstrated decreased prefrontal activation at high WM load, which may indicate increased processing efficiency. Although MCI patients showed improved behavioral performance at low WM load after training, no evidence was found for training-related changes in prefrontal activation. Whole-group analyses showed that a relatively strong hemodynamic response at low WM load was related to worse behavioral performance, while a relatively strong hemodynamic response at high WM load was related to higher training gain. Therefore, a 'youth-like' prefrontal activation pattern at older age may be associated with better behavioral outcome and cognitive plasticity.

TI  - The Humanoid Robot NAO as Trainer in a Memory Program for Elderly People with Mild Cognitive Impairment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ROBOTICS
AB  - Many studies on social interaction have used the humanoid robot NAO. In the present paper, we described our project designed to address the growing unmet need for alternative approaches to slowing the progression of cognitive decline in Mild Cognitive Impairment patients. NAO is the experimental platform used in an ecological setting: a center for the treatment of cognitive disorders and dementia of the Italian health service. This paper describes the study addressed to evaluate the effectiveness of human-robot interaction to reinforce therapeutic behavior and treatments adherence and presents the latest findings of functional tests and users investigation recently conducted. The robot was programmed to implement some tasks from the usual memory-training program protocol. In different training conditions, subjects participated in sessions with the support of NAO or only from the psychologist while the interaction was recorded for subsequent exploration. Data indicated that memory training with NAO resulted in an increase of visual gaze from patients and reinforce of therapeutic behavior reducing, in some cases, depressive symptoms. Unexpectedly, significant changes in prose memory and verbal fluency measures were detected. These findings suggest that further research on robotics in ecological settings is necessary to determine the extent to which they can effectively support clinical practice.

TI  - WOME: Theory-Based Working Memory Training - A Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind Evaluation in Older Adults
T2  - FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Background: Scientifically evaluated cognitive intervention programs are essential to meet the demands of our increasingly aging society. Currently, one of the "hottest" topics in the field is the improvement of working memory function and its potential impact on overall cognition. The present study evaluated the efficacy of WOME (WOrking MEmory), a theory-based working memory training program, in a double-blind, place-bocontrolled, and randomized controlled trial (www.drks.de , DRKS00013162).
   Methods: N = 60 healthy older adults were allocated to (1) the WOME intervention, (2) an active low-level intervention, or (3) a passive control group. Overall, the intervention groups practiced twelve sessions of 45 min within 4 weeks of their respective training. Transfer effects were measured via an extensive battery of neuropsychological tests and questionnaires both pre-/post-training and at a 3-month follow-up.
   Results: WOME led to a significant improvement in working memory function, demonstrated on a non-trained near transfer task and on two different composite scores with moderate to large effect sizes. In addition, we found some indication of relevant impact on everyday life. The effects were short-term rather than stable, being substantially diminished at follow-up with only little evidence suggesting long-term maintenance. No transfer effects on other cognitive functions were observed.
   Conclusion: WOME is an appropriate and efficient intervention specifically targeting the working memory system in healthy older adults.

TI  - Strategies for Improving Memory: A Randomized Trial of Memory Groups for Older People, Including those with Mild Cognitive Impairment
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE
AB  - Background: Governments are promoting the importance of maintaining cognitive health into older age to minimize risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Older people with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) are particularly vulnerable to memory challenges in daily activities and are seeking ways to maintain independent living.
   Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of memory groups for improving memory strategies and memory ability of older people, especially those with aMCI.
   Methods: 113 healthy older adults (HOA) and 106 adults with aMCI were randomized to a six-week memory group or a waitlist control condition. Outcome was evaluated through knowledge and use of memory strategies, memory ability (self-report and neuropsychological tests), and wellbeing. Assessments included a six-month follow-up.
   Results: Using intention to treat analyses, there were intervention effects for HOA and aMCI groups in strategy knowledge (HOA: eta(2) = 0.20; aMCI: eta(2) = 0.06), strategy use (HOA: eta(2) = 0.18; aMCI: eta(2) = 0.08), and wellbeing (HOA:eta(2) = 0.11; aMCI:eta(2) = 0.05). There were also intervention effects in the HOA group, but not the aMCI group, in self-reported memory ability (eta(2) = 0.06) and prospective memory tests (eta(2) = 0.02). By six-month follow-up, gains were found on most HOA outcomes. In the aMCI group gains were found in strategy use, and by this stage, gains in prospective memory were also found.
   Conclusion: Memory groups can engage older people in techniques for maintaining cognitive health and improve memory performance, but more modest benefits are seen for older adults with aMCI.

TI  - An evaluation of a working memory training scheme in older adults
T2  - FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Working memory is a cognitive process that is particularly vulnerable to decline with age. The current study sought to evaluate the efficacy of a working memory training scheme in improving memory in a group of older adults. A 5-week online training scheme was designed to provide training in the main components of Baddeley's (2000) working memory model, namely auditory and visuospatial short-term and working memory. A group of older adults aged between 64 and 79 were randomly assigned to a trainee (n = 19) or control (n=17) group, with trainees engaging in the adaptive training scheme and controls engaging in a non-adaptive version of the program Before and after training and at 3- and 6-month follow-up sessions, trainees and controls were asked to complete measures of short-term and working memory, long-term episodic memory, subjective ratings of memory, and attention and achievement of goals set at the beginging of training. The results provided evidence of an expansion of auditory short-term memory span, which was maintained 6 months later, and transfer to long-term episodic memory but no evidence of improvement in working memory capacity per se. A serendipitous and intriguing finding of a relationship between time spent training, psychological stress, and traingng gains provided further insight into individual differneces in training gains in older adults.

TI  - Is Blood Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor a Useful Biomarker to Monitor Mild Cognitive Impairment Patients?
T2  - REJUVENATION RESEARCH
AB  - Availability of reliable prognostic biomarkers that are also able to monitor preventive/therapeutic interventions in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is crucial. Cerebral brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) alterations were evidenced in Alzheimer's disease, but the value of blood BDNF in MCI is unclear, especially because of the incomplete/incorrect management of the numerous confounding factors unrelated to the disease. This study, applying a multidisciplinary methodological approach, aimed at clarifying whether blood BDNF can really mirror the cognitive symptoms of MCI, thus supporting the evaluation of clinical protocols' effectiveness as well as the definition of the conversion rate to dementia. Healthy elderly subjects (HE) and MCI patients were assessed for sociodemographic, neuropsychological, pharmacological, and lifestyle data, and plasma BDNF was measured (baseline); then, in the MCI cohort, the biomarker was tested in a comprehensive cognitive stimulation intervention (CS) as well as in a 2-year follow-up period. Plasma BDNF, cleansed from all the interfering factors, (1) did not discriminate HE and MCI patients; (2) in MCI patients reflected mood, social engagement, and subjective memory complaints but not cognition; (3) changed due to CS, although with no correlations to cognitive performances; and (4) predicted no functional deterioration. Our data indicate that the possible biased use of plasma BDNF in MCI is critically risky.

TI  - Would transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) enhance the effects of working memory training in older adults with mild neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial
T2  - TRIALS
AB  - Background: There has been longstanding interesting in cognitive training for older adults with cognitive impairment. In this study, we will investigate the effects of working memory training, and explore augmentation strategies that could possibly consolidate the effects in older adults with mild neurocognitive disorder. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been demonstrated to affect the neuronal excitability and reported to enhance memory performance. As tDCS may also modulate cognitive function through changes in neuroplastic response, it would be adopted as an augmentation strategy for working memory training in the present study.
   Methods/Design: This is a 4-week intervention double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) of tDCS. Chinese older adults (aged 60 to 90 years) with mild neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease (DSM-5 criteria) would be randomized into a 4-week intervention of either tDCS-working memory (DCS-WM), tDCS-control cognitive training (DCS-CC), and sham tDCS-working memory (WM-CD) groups. The primary outcome would be working memory test - the n-back task performance and the Chinese version of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog). Secondary outcomes would be test performance of specific cognitive domains and mood. Intention-to-treat analysis would be carried out. Changes of efficacy indicators with time and intervention would be tested with mixed effect models.
   Discussion: This study adopts the theory of neuroplasticity to evaluate the potential cognitive benefits of non-invasive electrical brain stimulation, working memory training and dual stimulation in older adults at risk of cognitive decline. It would also examine the tolerability, program adherence and adverse effects of this novel intervention. Information would be helpful for further research of dementia prevention studies.

TI  - Memory training (MT) in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) generates change in cognitive performance
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GERONTOLOGY AND GERIATRICS
AB  - Background: Longevity can be accompanied by several challenges, among them cognitive decline. The early identification of cognitive impairment offers the opportunity to act with the aim of preventing or delaying dementia. One potential intervention measure is MT.
   Objectives: To test the effect of MT in a sample of older individuals previously identified as having MCI.
   Methods: A randomized controlled clinical trial was carried out. Subjects were recruited by the local media for a memory study and were submitted to a battery of cognitive tests. Subjects meeting inclusion criteria (n = 112) were classified as normal controls (n = 65) and MCI (n = 47), according to Gauthier and Touchon's criteria (Gauthier & Touchon, 2005). The study sample was randomly assigned to three different intervention groups: MT group, educational intervention (EI) group, and control group (CG). The MT group received eight training sessions to learn mnemonic strategies based on ecological tasks. They also completed tasks which recruited attention and executive functions. Educational content on memory and aging was also offered. The EI participated in the same number of sessions, yet, only the educational content was offered. The CG completed pre- and post-test evaluations, and received training afterwards.
   Results: Training effects were modest and for certain variables they were equivalent to retest effects. However, after training, individuals with MCI in the MT group exhibited cognitive performance typical of individuals without cognitive impairment, suggesting cognitive plasticity.
   Conclusion: MT is a feasible non-pharmacological intervention which might bring positive performance change in older adults facing cognitive impairment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mental awareness improved mild cognitive impairment and modulated gut microbiome
T2  - AGING-US
AB  - There is ample scientific and clinical evidence of the effects of gut microbiota on the brain but no definitive evidence that the brain can affect changes in gut microbiota under the bi-directional gut-brain axis concept. As there is no pharmacotherapeutic intervention for the early stages of cognitive decline, research has focused on cognitive stimulation in reversing or slowing the impairment. Elderly patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment underwent a randomized-control trial of mindful awareness practice. Neuropsychological assessments, inflammatory markers, and gut microbiota profiles were tested. Here, we report that their cognitive impairment was improved and associated with changes in gut bacterial profile. A cognition-score-dependent-abundance was observed in Ruminococcus vs Recognition Trials (RT), Digit Span Backward (DSB), Semantic Fluency Span (SFS) and Memory Domain (MD); Coprococcus vs DSB, Color Trails Test 2 (CTT2) and Block Design (BD); Parabacteroides vs DSB and SFS; Fusobacterium vs DSB and CTT2; Enterobacteriaceae vs BD and SFS; Ruminococcaceae vs DSB; Phascolarctobacterium vs MD. The study showed for the first-time, alteration in the cognitive capacity leading to the corresponding changes in microbiota profiles. This strongly suggests that signals from the different segments of brain could dictate directly or indirectly the abundances of specific gut microbes.

TI  - Effectiveness of Nonpharmacological Approaches in Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment
T2  - NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES
AB  - Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients are at increased risk of developing dementia. There is a conflict if cognitive interventions can improve cognitive and functional performances in order to delay the development of dementia. Objectives: This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a holistic cognitive rehabilitation program on patients with MCI. Methods: The participants, 176 MCI patients with Mini-Mental State Examination = 27.89 (1.73), were classified into 2 groups matched for age, gender, education and cognitive abilities: (1) patients (104) on nonpharmacological therapy and (2) patients (72) on no therapy at all. The effectiveness of the interventions was assessed by neuropsychological evaluation performed at baseline and at the end of the interventions. Results: Between-group difference in benefit of the experimental group was demonstrated in abilities of executive function (p = 0.004), verbal memory (p = 0.003), praxis (p <= 0.012), daily function (p = 0.001) and general cognitive ability (p <= 0.005). The experimental patients improved cognitive and functional performances, while the control patients demonstrated deterioration in daily function (p = 0.004). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that nonpharmacological therapy of the holistic approach can improve MCI patients' cognitive and functional performances. Copyright (c) 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel

TI  - Cognitive Reserve in Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment: The Importance of Occupational Complexity as a Buffer of Declining Cognition in Older Adults
T2  - AIMS MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Cognitive reserve is the ability to optimize performance through differential recruitment of brain networks, which may reflect the use of alternative cognitive strategies. Work is one of the most important sources of cognitive stimulation during adulthood. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents an intermediate status between normal aging and dementia. As a consequence, this is considered a risk group regarding cognition. In order to study the probable association between occupational complexity and cognitive performance in a group of patients with MCI, a non-probabilistic intentional sample was dispensed on a group of 80 patients. Occupational complexity was explored by the Questionnaire on Agency of Labor Activity (CAAL, according to its acronym in Spanish) and a set of neuropsychological tests, which assessed cognitive performance in different areas: memory, attention, language and executive function, were administered. Results reveal that occupational complexity is associated to cognitive performance of elderly adults with MCI. With respect to working with Data, an increase in neuropsychological tests that demand high levels of attention and imply processing speed and working memory can be noted. Regarding the complexity of working with People, an association between the level of occupational complexity and an increase in verbal abilities and verbal reasoning can be seen. On the other hand, working with Things could be associated with better performance in specific areas of cognition such as visuospatial abilities. These results add up as empirical evidence to the fields of cognitive neurology and gerontology and to the cognitive reserve hypothesis, showing how complex environments can enhance cognition in old age. It adds evidence that help to understand which psychological, social and labor factors intervene in the cognitive reserve of an elder adult in cognitive risk.

TI  - The Memory Aid study: protocol for a randomized controlled clinical trial evaluating the effect of computer-based working memory training in elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
T2  - TRIALS
AB  - Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition characterized by memory problems that are more severe than the normal cognitive changes due to aging, but less severe than dementia. Reduced working memory (WM) is regarded as one of the core symptoms of an MCI condition. Recent studies have indicated that WM can be improved through computer-based training. The objective of this study is to evaluate if WM training is effective in improving cognitive function in elderly patients with MCI, and if cognitive training induces structural changes in the white and gray matter of the brain, as assessed by structural MRI.
   Methods/Designs: The proposed study is a blinded, randomized, controlled trail that will include 90 elderly patients diagnosed with MCI at a hospital-based memory clinic. The participants will be randomized to either a training program or a placebo version of the program. The intervention is computerized WM training performed for 45 minutes of 25 sessions over 5 weeks. The placebo version is identical in duration but is non-adaptive in the difficulty level of the tasks. Neuropsychological assessment and structural MRI will be performed before and 1 month after training, and at a 5-month folllow-up.
   Discussion: If computer-based training results in positive changes to memory functions in patients with MCI this may represent a new, cost-effective treatment for MCI. Secondly, evaluation of any training-induced structural changes to gray or white matter will improve the current understanding of the mechanisms behind effective cognitive interventions in patients with MCI.

TI  - Training gains and transfer effects after mnemonic strategy training in mild cognitive impairment: A fMRI study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Prior work has revealed that mnemonic strategy training (MST) can enhance memory for specific content and engages regions in the frontoparietal cognitive control network. Evidence of transfer to novel content is less clear. Here, we provide secondary analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired during a randomized controlled trial that compared MST to an active education control condition in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI). In the trial, thirty participants with a-MCI were randomized to the education program (EP) or MST, where they learned to apply the technique to face-name associations during four intervening hour long training sessions. Participants underwent pre- and post-training fMRI scans, during which they encoded both the trained (i.e., those used during the four training sessions) and untrained (`novel') face-name associations. The primary cognitive outcome measures revealed significantly improved memory for both trained and novel stimuli - effects supporting near transfer of MST. Relative to pre-training, there were significant and highly similar increases in activation for both trained and novel stimuli, especially in regions associated with the frontoparietal cognitive control network bilaterally, but also in temporal areas related to social cognition and emotional processing. Critically, this pattern of activation was notably different from the EP group. Thus, the changes in activation were consistent with the strategies trained and, combined with the cognitively-based near transfer effects, suggest that MST focused on face-name association enhances performance by engaging cognitive control and social/emotional processing. Finally, our data indicated that our MST is a relevant and efficient intervention to a-MCI.

TI  - Effectiveness of an Innovative Cognitive Treatment and Telerehabilitation on Subjects With Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Multicenter, Randomized, Active-Controlled Study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Background
   In recent years, the potential usefulness of cognitive training procedures in normal aging and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have received increased attention.
   Objective
   The main aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the face-to-face cognitive virtual reality rehabilitation system (VRRS) and to compare it to that of face-to-face cognitive treatment as usual for individuals with MCI. Moreover, we assessed the possibility of prolonging the effects of treatment with a telerehabilitation system.
   Methods
   A total of 49 subjects with MCI were assigned to 1 of 3 study groups in a randomized controlled trial design: (a) those who received face-to-face cognitive VRRS (12 sessions of individualized cognitive rehabilitation over 4 weeks) followed by telerehabilitation (36 sessions of home-based cognitive VRRS training, three sessions for week); (b) those who received face-to-face cognitive VRRS followed by at-home unstructured cognitive stimulation (36 sessions of home-based unstructured cognitive stimulation, three sessions for week); and (c) those who received face-to-face cognitive treatment as usual (12 sessions of face-to-face cognitive treatment as usual).
   Results
   An improvement in memory, language and visuo-constructional abilities was observed after the end of face-to-face VRRS treatment compared to face-to-face treatment as usual. The application of home-based cognitive VRRS telerehabilitation seems to induce more maintenance of the obtained gains than home-based unstructured stimulation.
   Discussion
   The present study provides preliminary evidence in support of individualized VRRS treatment and telerehabilitation delivery for cognitive rehabilitation and should pave the way for future studies aiming at identifying optimal cognitive treatment protocols in subjects with MCI.

TI  - Impact of 3-Day Combined Anodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation-Visuospatial Training on Object-Location Memory in Healthy Older Adults and Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE
AB  - Background: Associative object-location memory (OLM) is known to decline even in normal aging, and this process is accelerated in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Given the lack of curative treatment for Alzheimer's disease, activating cognitive resources during its preclinical phase might prevent progression to dementia.
   Objective: To evaluate the effects of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS) combined with an associative episodic memory training on OLM in MCI patients and in healthy elderly (HE).
   Methods: In a single-blind cross-over design, 16 MCI patients and 32 HE underwent a 3-day visuospatial OLM training paired with either 20 min or 30 s (sham) atDCS (1 mA, right temporoparietal cortex). Effects on immediate (training success) and long-term memory (1-month) were investigated by conducting Mixed Model analyses. In addition, the impact of combined intervention on within-session (online) and on between-session (offline) performance were explored.
   Results: OLM training+atDCS enhanced training success only in MCI patients, but not HE (difference n.s.). Relative performance gain was similar in MCI patients compared to HE under atDCS. No beneficial effect was found after 1-month. Exploratory analyses suggested a positive impact on online, but a negative effect on offline performance in MCI patients. In both groups, exploratory post-hoc analyses indicated an association between initially low-performers and greater benefit from atDCS.
   Conclusion: Cognitive training in MCI may be enhanced by atDCS, but further delineation of the impact of current brain state, as well as temporal characteristics of multi-session atDCS-training application, may be needed to induce longer-lasting effects.

TI  - Changes in Neural Connectivity and Memory Following a Yoga Intervention for Older Adults: A Pilot Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE
AB  - Background: No study has explored the effect of yoga on cognitive decline and resting-state functional connectivity.
   Objectives: This study explored the relationship between performance on memory tests and resting-state functional connectivity before and after a yoga intervention versus active control for subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
   Methods: Participants (>= 55 y) with MCI were randomized to receive a yoga intervention or active "gold-standard" control (i.e., memory enhancement training (MET)) for 12 weeks. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to map correlations between brain networks and memory performance changes over time. Default mode networks (DMN), language and superior parietal networks were chosen as networks of interest to analyze the association with changes in verbal and visuospatial memory performance.
   Results: Fourteen yoga and 11 MET participants completed the study. The yoga group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in depression and visuospatial memory. We observed improved verbal memory performance correlated with increased connectivity between the DMN and frontal medial cortex, pregenual anterior cingulate cortex, right middle frontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and left lateral occipital cortex. Improved verbal memory performance positively correlated with increased connectivity between the language processing network and the left inferior frontal gyms. Improved visuospatial memory performance correlated inversely with connectivity between the superior parietal network and the medial parietal cortex.
   Conclusion: Yoga may be as effective as MET in improving functional connectivity in relation to verbal memory performance. These findings should be confirmed in larger prospective studies.

TI  - The effects of a computer-based cognitive and physical training program in a healthy and mildly cognitive impaired aging sample
T2  - AGING & MENTAL HEALTH
AB  - Objectives: The Long Lasting Memories (LLM) program concerns a newly integrated platform which combines cognitive exercises with physical activity within the context of advanced technologies. The main objective of this study was to present the preliminary results that determine the possible effectiveness of the LLM program in the improvement of cognitive functions and symptoms of depression in healthy elderly and subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
   Method: Fifty healthy and MCI subjects participated in the study. All of them received one hour's physical training and 35 minutes' cognitive training, 3 times a week, during the 12 weeks of the program. Before and after the intervention all participants were assessed using a battery of neuropsychological tests.
   Results: The results showed a significant improvement after the LLM training in global cognitive function, in verbal memory, in attention, in episodic memory and symptoms of depression.
   Conclusion: This study indicates that LLM is a promising solution for older adults with and without cognitive impairment, maintaining their wellbeing with few professional and technical requirements.

TI  - Art therapy is associated with sustained improvement in cognitive function in the elderly with mild neurocognitive disorder: findings from a pilot randomized controlled trial for art therapy and music reminiscence activity versus usual care
T2  - TRIALS
AB  - BackgroundMild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a phase in cognitive decline when it is still possible to intervene to reverse the decline. Cognitive stimulation delivered through psychosocial interventions provides both psychological intervention and social stimulation to improve cognition. A pilot open-label parallel-arms randomized controlled trial was undertaken to examine the effects of art therapy (AT) and music reminiscence activity (MRA) compared to the control, on the primary outcome of neurocognitive domain assessments in elderly people with MCI.MethodsCommunity-living elderly people with MCI (Petersen's criteria), assessed for study eligibility, were randomized using a web-based system with equal allocation to two intervention arms: AT (guided viewing of art pieces and production of visual arts) and MRA (listening, and recalling memories related to music) and a control arm (standard care without any intervention). Interventions were led by trained therapists weekly for 3 months, then fortnightly for 6 months. Neurocognitive domains (mean of memory, attention, and visuo-spatial abilities standardized scores), psychological wellbeing (subsyndromal depression and anxiety) and telomere length as a biological marker of cellular ageing, were assessed by intervention-blinded assessors at baseline, 3 months and 9 months.ResultsIn total,250 people were screened and 68 were randomized and included in the analysis. In the AT arm, neurocognitive domains improved compared to the control arm at 3 months (mean difference (d)=0.40; 90% CI 0.126, 0.679) and were sustained at 9months (d=0.31; 90% CI 0.068, 0.548). There was some improvement in depression and anxiety at 3 and 9months and in telomere length at 9months, but this was not significant. Similar improvements were observed in the MRA arm over the control arm, but they were not significant. There were no intervention-related adverse effects.ConclusionsArt therapy delivered by trained staff as art as therapy and art psychotherapy may have been the significant contributor to cognitive improvements. The findings support cognitive stimulation for elderly people with cognitive decline and signal the need for larger studies and further investigation of carefully designed psycho-social interventions for this group.Trial registrationClinical Trials.gov, NCT02854085.

TI  - Neurochemical and Neuroanatomical Plasticity Following Memory Training and Yoga Interventions in Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment
T2  - FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Behavioral interventions are becoming increasingly popular approaches to ameliorate age-related cognitive decline, but their underlying neurobiological mechanisms and clinical efficiency have not been fully elucidated. The present study explored brain plasticity associated with two behavioral interventions, memory enhancement training (MET) and a mind-body practice (yogic meditation), in healthy seniors with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using structural magnetic resonance imaging (s-MRI) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1-MRS). Senior participants (age >55 years) with MCI were randomized to the MET or yogic meditation interventions. For both interventions, participants completed either MET training or Kundalini Yoga (KY) for 60-min sessions over 12 weeks, with 12-min daily homework assignments. Gray matter volume and metabolite concentrations in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and bilateral hippocampus were measured by structural MRI and H-1-MRS at baseline and after 12 weeks of training. Metabolites measured included glutamate-glutamine (Glx), choline-containing compounds (Cho, including glycerophosphocholine and phosphocholine), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and N-acetyl aspartate and N-acetylaspartyl-glutamate (NM-NAAG). In total, 11 participants completed MET and 14 completed yogic meditation for this study. Structural MRI analysis showed an interaction between time and group in dACC, indicating a trend towards increased gray matter volume after the MET intervention. H-1-MRS analysis showed an interaction between time and group in choline-containing compounds in bilateral hippocampus, induced by significant decreases after the MET intervention. Though preliminary, our results suggest that memory training induces structural and neurochemical plasticity in seniors with MCI. Further research is needed to determine whether mind-body interventions like yoga yield similar neuroplastic changes.

TI  - The impact of subjective memory complaints on quality of life in community-dwelling older adults
T2  - PSYCHOGERIATRICS
AB  - PurposeThe aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of memory complaints on quality of life (QOL) in elderly community dwellers with or without mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
   MethodsParticipants included 120 normal controls (NC) and 37 with MCI aged 65 and over. QOL was measured using the Japanese version of Satisfaction in Daily Life, and memory complaints were measured using a questionnaire consisting of four items. The relevance of QOL was evaluated with psychological factors of personality traits, sense of self-efficacy, depressive mood, self-evaluation of daily functioning, range of social activities (Life-Space Assessment), social network size, and cognitive functions including memory. The predictors of QOL were analyzed by multiple linear regression analysis.
   ResultsQOL was not significantly different between the NC and MCI groups. In both groups, QOL was positively correlated with self-efficacy, daily functioning, social network size, Life-Space Assessment, and the personality traits of extraversion and agreeableness; QOL was negatively correlated with memory complaints, depressive mood, and the personality trait of neuroticism. In regression analysis, memory complaints were a negative predictor of QOL in the MCI group, but not in the NC group. The partial correlation coefficient between QOL and memory complaints was -0.623 (P < 0.05), after scores of depressive mood and self-efficacy were controlled. Depressive mood was a common negative predictor in both groups. Positive predictors were Life-Space Assessment in the NC group and sense of self-efficacy in the MCI group.
   ConclusionsMemory complaints exerted a negative impact on self-rated QOL in the MCI group, whereas a negative correlation was weak in the NC group. Memory training has been widely practised in individuals with MCI to prevent the development of dementia. However, such approaches inevitably identify their memory deficits and could aggravate their awareness of memory decline. Thus, it is critical to give sufficient consideration not to reduce QOL in the intervention for those with MCI.

TI  - A complex multimodal activity intervention to reduce the risk of dementia in mild cognitive impairment-ThinkingFit: pilot and feasibility study for a randomized controlled trial
T2  - BMC PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background: Dementia affects 35 million people worldwide and is currently incurable. Many cases may be preventable because regular participation in physical, mental and social leisure activities during middle age is associated with up to 47% dementia risk reduction. However, the majority of middle-aged adults are not active enough. MCI is therefore a clear target for activity interventions aimed at reducing dementia risk. An active lifestyle during middle age reduces dementia risk but it remains to be determined if increased activity reduces dementia risk when MCI is already evident. Before this can be investigated conclusively, complex multimodal activity programmes are required that (1) combine multiple health promoting activities, (2) engage people with MCI, and (3) result in sufficient adherence rates.
   Methods: We designed the ThinkingFit programme to engage people with MCI in a complex intervention comprised of three activity components: physical activity, group-based cognitive stimulation (GCST) and individual cognitive stimulation (ICST). Engagement and adherence was promoted by applying specific psychological techniques to enhance behavioural flexibility in an early pre-phase and during the course of the intervention. To pilot the intervention, participants served as their own controls during a 6- to 12-week run-in period, which was followed by 12 weeks of activity intervention.
   Results: Out of 212 MCI patients screened, 163 were eligible, 70 consented and 67 completed the intervention (mean age 74 years). Activity adherence rates were high: physical activity = 71%; GCST = 83%; ICST = 67%. Significant treatment effects (p < .05) were evident on physical health outcomes (decreased BMI and systolic blood pressure, [pre/post values of 26.3/25.9 kg/m(2) and 145/136 mmHg respectively]), fitness (decreased resting and recovery heart rate [68/65 bpm and 75/69 bpm]), and cognition (improved working memory [5.3/6.3 items]).
   Conclusions: We found satisfactory recruitment, retention and engagement rates, coupled with significant treatment effects in elderly MCI patients. It appears feasible to conduct randomized controlled trials of the dementia prevention potential of complex multimodal activity programmes like ThinkingFit.

TI  - Voluntary aerobic exercise increases the cognitive enhancing effects of working memory training
T2  - BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH
AB  - Increases in performance on tests of attention and learning are often observed shortly after a period of aerobic exercise, and evidence suggests that humans who engage in regular exercise are partially protected from age-related cognitive decline. However, the cognitive benefits of exercise are typically short-lived, limiting the practical application of these observations. Here, we explored whether physical exercise might induce lasting changes in general cognitive ability if that exercise was combined with working memory training, which is purported to broadly impact cognitive performance. Mice received either exercise treatment (6 weeks of voluntary running wheel access), working memory training (in a dual radial-arm maze), both treatments, or various control treatments. After this period of exercise, working memory training was initiated (alternating with days of exercise), and continued for several weeks. Upon completion of these treatments, animals were assessed (2-4 weeks later) for performance on four diverse learning tasks, and the aggregate performance of individual animals across all four learning tasks was estimated. Working memory training alone promoted small increases in general cognitive performance, although any beneficial effects of exercise alone had dissipated by the time of learning assessments. However, the two treatments in combination more than doubled the improvement in general cognitive performance supported by working memory training alone. Unlike the transient effects that acute aerobic exercise can have on isolated-learning tasks, these results indicate that an acute period of exercise combined with working memory training can have synergistic and lasting impact on general cognitive performance.

TI  - There is no convincing evidence that working memory training is effective: A reply to Au et al. (2014) and Karbach and Verhaeghen (2014)
T2  - PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN & REVIEW
AB  - The possible cognitive benefits of working memory training programs have been the subject of intense interest and controversy. Recently two meta-analyses have claimed that working memory training can be effective in enhancing cognitive skills in adulthood (Au et al. Behavioural Brain Research 228:(1) 107-115, 2014) and stemming cognitive decline in old age (Karbach & Verhaeghen Psychological Science 25: 2027-2037, 2014). The current article critically evaluates these claims. We argue that these meta-analyses produce misleading results because of (1) biases in the studies included, (2) a failure to take account of baseline differences when calculating effect sizes, and (3) a failure to emphasize the difference between studies with treated versus untreated control groups. We present new meta-analyses and conclude that there is no convincing evidence that working memory training produces general cognitive benefits.

TI  - Development of the Ubiquitous Spaced Retrieval-Based Memory Advancement and Rehabilitation Training Program
T2  - PSYCHIATRY INVESTIGATION
AB  - Objective The Ubiquitous Spaced Retrieval-based Memory Advancement and Rehabilitation Training (USMART) program was developed by transforming the spaced retrieval-based memory training which consisted of 24 face-to-face sessions into a self-administered program with an iPAD app. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of USMART in elderly subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
   Methods Feasibility was evaluated by checking the satisfaction of the participants with a 5-point Likert scale. The efficacy of the program on cognitive functions was evaluated by the Korean version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Neuropsychological Assessment Battery before and after USMART.
   Results Among the 10 participants, 7 completed both pre- and post-USMART assessments. The overall satisfaction score was 8.0 +/- 1.0 out of 10. The mean Word List Memory Test (WLMT) scores significantly increased after USMART training after adjusting for age, educational levels, baseline Mini-Mental Status Examination scores, and the number of training sessions (pre-USMART, 16.0 +/- 4.1; post-USMART, 17.9 +/- 4.5; p=0.014, RM-ANOVA). The magnitude of the improvements in the WLMT scores significantly correlated with the number of training sessions during 4 weeks (r=0.793; p=0.033).
   Conclusion USMART was effective in improving memory and was well tolerated by most participants with MCI, suggesting that it may be a convenient and cost-effective alternative for the cognitive rehabilitation of elderly subjects with cognitive impairments. Further studies with large numbers of participants are necessary to examine the relationship between the number of training sessions and the improvements in memory function.

TI  - Multistrategic Memory Training with the Metamemory Concept in Healthy Older Adults
T2  - PSYCHIATRY INVESTIGATION
AB  - Objective According to the increase of older people, the need for effective methods to maintain or improve cognitive functions in the elderly has increased. These cognitive enhancing methods may contribute to the prevention of elderly cognitive decline by aging and dementing illness as well. This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of multistrategic memory training with the metamemory concept on cognitive functions in the normal health elderly in Korea.
   Methods The program used in this study was developed by psychiatrists and psychologists in accordance with Korean situations. We applied the training program to the community-dwelling elderly with subjective memory complaints. Twenty participants were randomly received the intervention with 20 non-treatment controls. This program consisted of 10 sessions and was administered once a week. We examined the effects of this memory training for verbal memory, visuospatial memory, working memory, and verbal fluency ability by repeated ANOVA.
   Results There were significant improvements in Word List Short-term Delayed Free and Cued Recall, Word list Long-term Delayed Free and Cued Recall and visuospatial recognition memory. Performance improvements in visuospatial span forwards and the Categorical Fluency Test were also significant. These improvements were still significant after adjusting for depression improvement exact categorical fluency.
   Conclusion This study shows that multistrategic memory training with the metamemory concept may improve memory ability and other cognitive functions which are not trained and that these improvements may be achieved by pure cognitive training effects. Psychiatry Investig 2011;8:354-361

TI  - Activation and Effective Connectivity Changes Following Explicit-Memory Training for Face-Name Pairs in Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Pilot Study
T2  - NEUROREHABILITATION AND NEURAL REPAIR
AB  - Background. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is often a precursor to Alzheimer disease. Little research has examined the efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation in patients with MCI, and the relevant neural mechanisms have not been explored. The authors previously showed the behavioral efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation using mnemonic strategies for face-name associations in patients with MCI. Here, the authors used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test whether there were training-specific changes in activation and connectivity within memory-related areas. Methods. A total of 6 patients with amnestic, multidomain MCI underwent pretraining and posttraining fMRI scans, during which they encoded 90 novel face-name pairs and completed a 4-choice recognition memory test immediately after scanning. Patients were taught mnemonic strategies for half the face-name pairs during 3 intervening training sessions. Results. Training-specific effects comprised significantly increased activation within a widespread cerebral cortical network involving medial frontal, parietal, and occipital regions; the left frontal operculum and angular gyrus; and regions in the left lateral temporal cortex. Increased activation common to trained and untrained stimuli was found in a separate network involving inferior frontal, lateral parietal, and occipital cortical regions. Effective connectivity analysis using multivariate, correlation-purged Granger causality analysis revealed generally increased connectivity after training, particularly involving the middle temporal gyrus and foci in the occipital cortex and the precuneus. Conclusion. The authors' findings suggest that the effectiveness of explicit-memory training in patients with MCI is associated with training-specific increases in activation and connectivity in a distributed neural system that includes areas involved in explicit memory.

TI  - Memory rehabilitation for older adults: preserving independent living
T2  - ESTUDIOS DE PSICOLOGIA
AB  - Episodic memory problems are the hallmark of cognitive ageing in normal elderly people. Learning of new material is worse in pathological cognitive ageing, such as dementia and its preliminary states (mild cognitive impairment). Because episodic learning is crucial to preserve independent living in the elderly, rehabilitation programmes for everyday memory problems are welcomed. The scope of scientific interest has switched from treatment to prevention. We claim that lifestyle interventions are the most direct way to preserve cognition. We summarize evidence for changes in nutrition and exercise. In addition, psychological interventions for elderly people with normal or pathological cognitive ageing are available. Recent meta-analyses found lacking evidence of transfer to everyday life and long-term effects. We critically assess these meta-analyses. We propose theoretically derived experimental interventions relying on spared learning mechanisms. As an example we report visual-imagery training showing positive effects in a randomized control trial, using individual memory diaries on memory improvement.

TI  - Differential effectiveness for two memory training programs in older adults with subjective memory complaints (mnemonic training vs. everyday forgetfulness training): an exploratory analysis
T2  - ANALES DE PSICOLOGIA
AB  - Introduction: Despite the cognitive decline that occurs with age, several studies have showed the effectiveness of memory training programs for improving some neurocognitive functions in older people. Objective: to analyze in a preliminary way the differential effect of two memory training programs on several areas of cognition in older adults. Method: 18 older adults between 61 and 81 years have participated, either in a memory strategies training program, either an everyday forgetfulness training program. All of them evaluated the subjective perception of memory and cognitive performance before and after training. Results: A statistically significant improvement in the questionnaire of subjective memory complaints was found in both groups, and only the group receiving everyday forgetfulness training improved in some cognitive performances in visuospatial working memory (Corsi test reverse) and reasoning (analogies). Conclusions: Memory training programs improve the subjective perception that older people have about its functioning, and this is independent of training methodology used.

TI  - Feasibility of using a computer-assisted working memory training program for healthy older women
T2  - COGNITIVE PROCESSING
AB  - Interventions for age-associated cognitive impairment are of increasing significance as populations age. Using N-back and memory strategy enhancement, the present study aimed to explore the feasibility of using, and outcomes of a working memory (WM) training program on visuospatial and verbal WM in older female adults. Older women from two comparable local health centers who scored 26 and higher on Mini-Mental State Examination were invited to participate. Women at one center (experimental group) received three sessions on memory enhancement techniques and a computerized training program with N-back. Women at the other center (control group) received three sessions on memory and aging and training on using various features of cellphones. All participants completed the Corsi Block Task and Digit Span Task at pre- and post-training. The experimental group showed significant improvements in their visuospatial and verbal WM compared to the control group. These findings support the brain's plasticity in the elderly. WM training for improving cognitive performance in older adults has potential and should be further investigated.

TI  - Does cognitive training improve attention/working memory in persons with MS? A pilot study using the Cogmed Working Memory Training program
T2  - MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND RELATED DISORDERS
AB  - Background: Cognitive deficits, especially in attention, are common in persons with MS (PwMS) and are associated with clinically meaningful outcomes, such as work disability and lower quality of life (QOL). In this study, we aimed to determine whether Cogmed Working Memory Training (CWMT) improves attention/working memory in PwMS displaying impairment in these domains.
   Methods: This single blind, randomized controlled, pilot study compared the effects of CWMT, a five-week evidenced-based computer-assisted training program that is supported by weekly meetings with a coach, to standard medical care (treatment as usual). We recruited PwMS from one MS center (London (ON) Canada), aged 18-64, with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of ? 7.0, and a visual acuity (corrected) of at least 20/70. Potential subjects had to demonstrate impaired attention on at least two of three measures (Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test [PASAT], Symbol Digit Modalities Test [SDMT], and/or DKEFS Color-Word Interference Test); these measures also served as the primary study outcomes. Subjects were randomized to either the CWMT or treatment as usual. Secondary cognitive outcomes included other measures of attention, memory, as well as a self-reported cognitive function measure. Self-reported measures of mood (depression and anxiety), pain, and QOL were also included as other secondary outcomes. Subjects received assessments at baseline, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up, or an equivalent time period for the treatment as usual group. The two groups were compared at baseline on background measures using independent samples t-tests, Chi-Square tests, and MannWhitney U tests. To analyze primary and secondary outcomes, a non-parametric approach was used due the small sample size and that many of our outcomes did not meet assumptions for parametric analyses. Friedman?s test was conducted followed by post hoc pairwise comparisons within each group using Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests with Bonferroni corrected post hoc contrasts, which allowed us to examine for differences between time points.
   Results: Of 30 subjects, 15 were assigned to CWMT. Significant training effects were noted in 1 of 3 primary attentional outcomes (DKEFS Color-Word Interference Test), 2 of 3 secondary attentional outcomes (LetterNumber Sequencing, Digit Span), and 1 mood scale (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) - Depression Subscale), ps < .025. No significant changes were observed in the treatment as usual group.
   Conclusion: This pilot study demonstrates that cognitive training with CWMT has the potential to improve attention/working memory in PwMS, as well as a potential positive effect on mood, in PwMS. Further exploration of this intervention in PwMS with attention/working memory impairment is warranted.

TI  - Cognitive stimulation in cognitively impaired individuals and cognitively healthy individuals with a family history of dementia: short-term results from the "Allena-Mente" randomized controlled trial
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Objective: We evaluated the short-term efficacy of a protocol of cognitive stimulation (CS), compared with a sham intervention, on cognitive performance in cognitively healthy individuals with a family history of dementia (NDFAM) and in non-demented individuals with cognitive impairment (CI).
   Methods: We performed a randomized controlled trial of CS in NDFAM and CI. CS consisted in 10 twice weekly meetings of CS focused on a specific cognitive area. CS was compared with a sham intervention (CT) using Mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the Corsi test. All study participants were typed for the presence of apolipoprotein E (APOE)-epsilon 4.
   Results: Cognitively healthy NDFAM showed a higher net cognitive gain after CS, as reflected in their MoCA score, and a borderline significant net increase in visuospatial memory (Corsi test) compared with those receiving the CT. APOE-epsilon 4 carriers showed a less significant improvement on the Corsi test with respect to APOE-epsilon 4 non-carriers. In the CI sample, the MoCA and Corsi test results did not differ between the cognitively stimulated subjects and the controls. No changes in MMSE scores were found in either sample of subjects.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that CS as structured in this study is an effective treatment in cognitively healthy individuals, whereas it is less effective in individuals with CI. Moreover, evaluation of APOE-epsilon 4 status provided evidence of a substantial genetic contribution to the efficacy of CS on visuospatial memory as measured using the Corsi test.

TI  - Telehealth Home Support During COVID-19 Confinement for Community-Dwelling Older Adults With Mild Cognitive Impairment or Mild Dementia: Survey Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: The public health emergency of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is rapidly evolving worldwide; some countries, including Spain, have implemented restrictive measures. Populations that are vulnerable to this outbreak and its physical and mental health effects include community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia. Telehealth is a potential tool to deliver health care and decrease exposure risk.
   Objective: The aims of this study were to explore the impact of confinement on the health and well-being of community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, to provide television-based and telephone-based health and social support, and to study the effects of a television-based assistive integrated technology, TV-AssistDem (TeleVision-based AS Sistive Integrated Service to supporT European adults living with mild DEMentia or mild cognitive impairment).
   Methods: A telephone-based survey was administered in Spain to 93 participants in the TV-AssistDem clinical trial from March 25 to April 6, 2020.
   Results: Of the respondents, 60/93 (65%) were women. The mean age was 73.34 (SD 6.07), and 69/93 (74%) lived accompanied. Lockdown measures forced 17/93 respondents (18%) to change their living arrangements. Health status was found to be optimal in 89/93 respondents (96%), with no COVID-19 symptoms. Grocery and pharmacy outings were performed by family members of 68/93 participants (73%); 57 (61%) reported overall well-being, and 65 (70%) maintained their sleep quality. However, participants living alone reported greater negative feelings and more sleeping problems. Regarding leisure activities, 53/93 respondents (57%) took walks, 32 (35%) played memory games, 55 (60%) watched television, and 91(98%) telephoned relatives. 58/93 (64%) respondents reported accessing moderate or too much COVID-19 information, 89 (97%) received it from television, and 56 (62%) stated that their understanding of the information was extreme. 39/93 (39%) respondents had contacted health and social services, while 29 (31%) requested information regarding these services during the telephone call. There were no significant differences in health and well-being between the intervention and control groups. Respondents with TV-AssistDem performed more memory exercises (24/93, 52% vs 8/93, 17.4%; P<.001) than control respondents.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that during COVID-19 confinement, the physical and mental health and well-being was optimal for the majority of our vulnerable population. However, those living alone reported greater negative psychological effects and sleeping problems. Measures adopted to address the negative experiences of confinement included keeping informed about the situation, accessing health and social services, having a support network that prevents risk of exposure to COVID-19 and guarantees food and medical supplies, a daily routine with maintained sleeping habits and leisure activities, staying physically and mentally active with cognitive stimulation exercises, and ensuring social connectedness using technology. Television sets were preferred technological devices to access COVID-19 information, watch television as a recreational activity, and perform memory exercises as an intellectual activity. Television-based telehealth support using TV-AssistDem demonstrated potential for cognitive stimulation.

TI  - Simultaneous Aerobic Exercise and Memory Training Program in Older Adults with Subjective Memory Impairments
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE
AB  - Background: Several modifiable lifestyle factors have been shown to have potential beneficial effects in slowing cognitive decline. Two such factors that may affect cognitive performance and slow the progression of memory loss into dementia in older adults are cognitive training and physical activity. There are currently no effective treatments for dementia; therefore, preventative strategies to delay or prevent the onset of dementia are of critical importance.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the relative effectiveness of simultaneous performance of memory training and aerobic exercise to a sequential performance intervention on memory functioning in older adults.
   Methods: 55 older adults (aged 60-75) with subjective memory impairments (non-demented and non-MCI) completed the intervention that consisted of 90-minute small group classes held twice weekly. Participants were randomized to either 4-weeks of supervised strategy-based memory training done simultaneously while stationary cycling (SIM) or sequentially after the stationary cycling (SEQ). Standardized neurocognitive measures of memory, executive functioning, speed of processing, attention, and cognitive flexibility were assessed at baseline and post-intervention.
   Results: The SIM group, but not the SEQ group, had a significant improvement on composite memory following the intervention (t(51) = 2.7, p = 0.01, effect size (ES) = 0.42) and transfer to non-trained reasoning abilities (t(51) = 6.0, ES = 0.49) and complex attention (t(51) = 3.1, p = 0.003, ES = 0.70). Conversely, the SEQ group, but not the SIM, showed significant improvement in executive functioning (t(51) = 5.0, p = 0.0001, ES = 0.96).
   Conclusion: These findings indicate that a 4-week simultaneous memory training and aerobic exercise program is sufficient to improve memory, attention, and reasoning abilities in older adults.

TI  - Memory intervention : the value of a clinical holistic program for older adults with memory impairments
T2  - AGING & MENTAL HEALTH
AB  - Objectives: Increasingly, cognitive training appears an asset in improving attention and working memory for older adults. We conducted a study involving a holistic' training program for several cohorts of older adults (N = 112), targeting community residents with a spectrum of memory complaints ranging from Age Associated Memory Impairment to mild dementia.Method: We developed a 7-session, manualized program targeting concentration, as well as mindfulness, exercise, stress reduction, socialization, diet, and values/identity techniques. We applied this model to 11 cohorts and conducted pre- and post-testing on memory (List Learning, Story Memory, Coding, Digit Span, Recall, and Recognition) and function (Functional Assessment Questionnaire). We also divided the Memory Group by Risk Status - Low, Medium, and High.Results: Results showed that the Memory Clinic Group as a whole improved on this training on most scales. When broken down by risk status, the Low and Medium Risk Groups were statistically superior to the High Risk Group on cognitive measures.Conclusion: There were differences also on adjustment, this time favoring only the Low Risk Groups. Holistic memory training seems to be impactful for older adults.

TI  - Cognitive stimulation in children with cerebral palsy
T2  - REVISTA DE NEUROLOGIA
AB  - Introduction. Cerebral palsy is often accompanied by cognitive impairment affecting attention, visuoperception, executive functions and working memory.
   Aims. To analyse the effect of cognitive stimulation treatment on the cognitive capabilities in children with cerebral palsy.
   Patients and methods. Our sample consisted of 15 children with cerebral palsy, with a mean age of 8.80 +/- 2.51 years, who were classified with the aid of the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) on level I (n = 6), level II (n = 4), level III (n = 2) and level V (n = 3). Cognitive impairment was evaluated by means of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV) and the Continuous Performance Test (CPT-II). Both the questionnaires for parents and teachers from the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) and the Conners rating scales (CPRS-48 and CTRS-28) were administered. A cognitive stimulation programme was carried out at a rate of two hours a week for a total of eight weeks.
   Results. Statistically significant differences were observed after applying the cognitive stimulation treatment in the perceptive reasoning index of the WISC-IV. No differences were obtained on the Conners' and the BRIEF scores before and after the treatment. Neither were any differences found in the results on the WISC-IV according to sex or on the GMFCS.
   Conclusions. The cognitive performance of children with cerebral palsy improves after applying a cognitive rehabilitation programme.

TI  - Alzheimer disease: are we intervening too late?
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEURAL TRANSMISSION
AB  - The affirmative position is argued in response to the question of whether intervention in the disease course of Alzheimer disease (AD) occurs too late. AD is not a singular, homogeneous disease, but rather a final common pathway or end-point that can be arrived at through multiple routes. As part of the affirmative argument, there is a delineation of two long-term trajectories leading to AD: (1) normal elderly progression to AD, and (2) depressed elderly progression to AD. In documenting normal elderly devolution into AD, two "normal" elderly pre-AD or prodromal stages are discussed: age-associated memory impairment (AAMI) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Data are provided evidencing significantly high conversion rates from these pre-AD stages to actual AD. Using the same paradigmatic approach that is used in documenting normal elderly decline into AAMI and MCI with eventual conversion to AD; there is explication of depressed elderly conversion to AD. The long-term, multiphasic disease progression of major depression without dementia to depressive dementia to final conversion to AD is brought into focus as another example of why intervention must occur prior to actual conversion to AD. Depression is defined as a cognitive syndrome and risk factor for AD requiring aggressive targeted intervention. AD does not just come suddenly out of nowhere. First intervention must occur during the pre-AD phases in an attempt to prevent, delay, and interrupt long-term neurodegenerative processes involved in both normal elderly and depressed elderly conversion to AD. A primary strategy proposed is to delay onset of AD. Population statistics indicate that if AD is delayed by a modest 1 year, there would be 9.5 million fewer cases by 2050, resulting in significant reduction in burden of disease. Data show early intervention with cognitive stimulation (mental exercise), physical exercise, aggressive treatment of AD risk factors and excess disability, psychotherapy, and other nonpharmacological interventions in combination with each other and/or with medications can result in delay of onset of AD. First intervention at time of diagnosis of AD is too late, when by definition, final conversion to AD has already occurred. When we have knowledge to successfully intervene earlier, why would we not want to do so.

TI  - Effects of Combined Physical and Cognitive Virtual Reality-Based Training on Cognitive Impairment and Oxidative Stress in MCI Patients: A Pilot Study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - The growing elderly population and the increased incidence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) call for the improvement of the quality and the efficacy of the healthcare and social support services. Exercise and cognitive stimulation have been demonstrated to mitigate cognitive impairment and oxidative stress (OxS) has been recognized as a factor that contributes to the advancement of neurodegenerative diseases. Taking these aspects into account, the impact of a novel virtual reality (VR)-based program combining aerobic exercise and cognitive training has been evaluated in the pilot study proposed here. Ten patients (aged 73.3 +/- 5.7 years) with MCI (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE: 23.0 +/- 3.4) were randomly assigned to either 6 weeks physical and cognitive training (EXP) or control (CTR) group. Evaluations of cognitive profile, by a neuropsychological tests battery, and OxS, by collection of blood and urine samples, were performed before and at the end of the experimental period. The assessment of the patients' opinions toward the intervention was investigated through questionnaires. EXP group showed a tendency towards improvements in the MMSE, in visual-constructive test and visuo-spatial tests of attention, while CTR worsened. EXP group showed a greater improvement than CTR in the executive test, memory functions and verbal fluency. No statistical significance was obtained when comparing within and between both the groups, probably due to small number of subjects examined, which amplifies the effect of the slight heterogeneity in scores recorded. Despite a greater worsening of Daily Living Activities tests, all participants reported a better performance in real life, thanks to the elicited self-perceived improvement. After training intervention OxS (i.e., reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, oxidative damage of lipids and DNA) decreased resulting in significantly (range p < 0.05-0.001) lower in EXP vs. CTR group. Although not conclusive, the recorded effects in the present study are promising and suggest that this proposal would be a useful tool in support of cognitive training reducing OxS too. However, further studies on larger scale samples of patients are needed.

TI  - Occupational Therapy Prevents Cognitive Impairment on Long-Term Care Residents
T2  - PHYSICAL & OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY IN GERIATRICS
AB  - Aims: Cognitive impairment causes functional impairment and declining quality of life in the elderly. Occupational therapy (OT) could help to prevent or slow cognitive decline. However, little is known of how OT parameters could influence cognitive impairment. Methods: We conducted an observational study over the course of 1 year, on 94 long-term care residents, analyzing cognitive impairment. The cohort was split into three groups, each being provided with different amounts of OT (non-OT, 2 h OT a week, and 10 11 OT a week), The OT program consisted of cogniive and memory training, reality orientation, psychomotor activities, and crafts. Results: Our results show that OT is effective in slowing cognitive decline and its effectiveness seems to be proportional to the hours of OT received. The 10 11 OT group showed significantly reduced Mini-Mental State Examination score compared with the non-OT group (p < 0.01). OT also appears to be useful in people with previous cognitive impairment Conclusions: The study, adds to the growing literature of OT interventions for older adults and our findings support the concept that OT could be effective in slowing cognitive impairment in the elderly.

TI  - Effects of Cognitive Training on Gray Matter Volumes in Memory Clinic Patients with Subjective Memory Impairment
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE
AB  - Subjective memory impairment (SMI) is a common risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, with few established options for treatment. Here we investigate the effects of two months episodic memory training on regional brain atrophy in 19 memory clinic patients with SMI. We used a sensitive longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging protocol and compared the patients with 42 matched healthy volunteers randomly assigned to a group performing the same training, or a no- training control group. Following intervention, the SMI sample exhibited structural gray matter volume increases in brain regions encompassing the episodic memory network, with cortical volume expansion of comparable extent as healthy training participants. Further, we found significant hippocampal volume increases in the healthy training group but not in the SMI group. Still, individual differences in left hippocampal volume change in the patient group were related to verbal recall improvement following training. The present results reinforce earlier studies indicating intact brain plasticity in aging, and further suggest that training- related brain changes can be evident also in the earliest form of cognitive impairment.

TI  - No Effects of Non-invasive Brain Stimulation on Multiple Sessions of Object-Location-Memory Training in Healthy Older Adults
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Object-location memory (OLM) is known to decline with normal aging, a process accelerated in pathological conditions like mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In order to maintain cognitive health and to delay the transition from healthy to pathological conditions, novel strategies are being explored. Tentative evidence suggests that combining cognitive training and anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS), both reported to induce small and often inconsistent behavioral improvements, could generate larger or more consistent improvements or both, compared to each intervention alone. Here, we explored the combined efficacy of these techniques on OLM. In a subject-blind sham-controlled cross-over design 32 healthy older adults underwent a 3-day visuospatial training paired with either anodal (20 min) or sham (30 s) atDCS (1 mA, temporoparietal). Subjects were asked to learn the correct object-location pairings on a street map, shown over five learning blocks on each training day. Acquisition performance was assessed by accuracy on a given learning block in terms of percentage of correct responses. Training success (performance on last training day) and delayed memory after 1-month were analyzed by mixed model analysis and were controlled for gender, age, education, sequence of stimulation and baseline performance. Exploratory analysis of atDCS effects on within-session (online) and between-session (offline) memory performance were conducted. Moreover, transfer effects on similar trained (visuospatial) and less similar (visuo-constructive, verbal) untrained memory tasks were explored, both immediately after training, and on follow-up. We found that atDCS paired with OLM-training did not enhance success in training or performance in 1-month delayed memory or transfer tasks. In sum, this study did not support the notion that the combined atDCS-training approach improves immediate or delayed OLM in older adults. However, specifics of the experimental design, and a non-optimal timing of atDCS between sessions might have masked beneficial effects and should be more systematically addressed in future studies.

TI  - Aging-Related Oxidative Stress: Positive Effect of Memory Training
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - The cognitive impairment characterizing the phenotype of older adults has been related to the efficiency of the antioxidant system. This study aimed at investigating the effect of memory training (MT) on memory, global cognitive functioning, and the oxidant and antioxidant capacity of plasma. We recruited 52 healthy subjects aged over 60. Twenty-nine subjects were submitted to 6-months of MT (Experimental Group, EG), and 23 were used as a Control Group (CG). Global cognitive functioning was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Short- and Long-Term Memory (STM and LTM, respectively) by the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) at baseline (T0) and after 6-months (T1). Meanwhile, Reactive Oxygen Metabolites derivative compounds (d-ROMs), Biological Antioxidant Potential (BAP), and their ratio were evaluated on plasma. Results showed that the MMSE and RAVLT scores improved in EG at T1. At the same time, the d-ROMs levels significantly decreased, while the BAP and BAP/d-ROMs ratio showed an opposite trend. In both groups, the MMSE and LTM scores were negatively associated with d-ROMs levels, and positively correlated with BAP levels and the BAP/d-ROMs ratio. When we considered the Delta value (Delta variable = variable post-MT minus variable pre-MT) in EG, the Delta MMSE and Delta LTM scores were negatively associated to Delta d-ROMs, and positively to Delta BAP and Delta BAP/dROM. In conclusion, our results suggest that MT improves memory and global cognitive functioning. These processes were significantly associated to increase in resistance against oxidative stress at the plasma level in healthy older adults.

TI  - Memory Strategy Training in Older Adults with Subjective Memory Complaints: A Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL SOCIETY
AB  - Objectives: Subjective memory complaints (SMC) in older adults are associated with a decline in everyday functioning and an increased risk for future cognitive decline. This study examines the effect of a memory strategy training compared to a control memory training on memory functioning in daily life. Methods: This was a randomized controlled trial with baseline, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up assessments conducted in 60 older adults (50-87 years) with SMC. Participants were randomly assigned to either seven sessions of memory strategy training or seven sessions of control memory training. Both interventions were given in small groups and included psycho-education. Primary outcome measure was memory functioning in daily life. Objective measures of memory performance and self-reported measures of strategy use were included as secondary outcome measures. Results: Participants in each intervention group reported an improvement in personal memory goals (p < .0005), up to 6 months after training. An interaction effect showed that participants following memory strategy training reported a larger improvement in personal memory goals (p = .002). Both intervention groups improved on two memory tests (p < .001 and p < .01). In the memory strategy training group, an increase in strategy use in daily life was the strongest predictor (p < .05) of improvement in subjective memory functioning. Conclusions: Older adults with subjective memory complaints benefit from memory strategy training, especially in their memory functioning in daily life.

TI  - Is Computerized Working Memory Training Effective in Healthy Older Adults? Evidence from a Multi-Site, Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE
AB  - Background: Developing effective interventions to attenuate age-related cognitive decline and prevent or delay the onset of dementia are major public health goals. Computerized cognitive training (CCT) has been marketed increasingly to older adults, but its efficacy remains unclear. Working memory (WM), a key determinant of higher order cognitive abilities, is susceptible to age-related decline and a relevant target for CCT in elders.
   Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of CCT focused on WM compared to an active control condition in healthy older adults.
   Methods: Eighty-two cognitively normal adults from two sites (USA and Sweden) were randomly assigned to Cogmed Adaptive or Non-Adaptive (active control) CCT groups. Training was performed in participants' homes, five days per week over five weeks. Changes in the performance of the Cogmed trained tasks, and in five neuropsychological tests (Trail Making Test Part A and Part B, Digit Symbol, Controlled Oral Word Association Test and Semantic Fluency) were used as outcome measures.
   Results: The groups were comparable at baseline. The Adaptive group showed robust gains in the trained tasks, and there was a time-by-group interaction for the Digit Symbol test, with significant improvement only after Adaptive training. In addition, the magnitude of the intervention effect was similar at both sites.
   Conclusion: Home-based CCT Adaptive WM training appears more effective than Non-Adaptive training in older adults from different cultural backgrounds. We present evidence of improvement in trained tasks and on a demanding untrained task dependent upon WM and processing speed. The benefits over the active control group suggest that the Adaptive CCT gains were linked to providing a continuously challenging level of WM difficulty.

TI  - A Computerized Assessment of Verbal and Visuospatial Memory (Dys)functions in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCH AND BEHAVIOR MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory systemic disease associated with various degrees of impairment across different cognitive domains. We aimed to provide a detailed computerized investigation of verbal and visuospatial short-term and working memory (dys)functions in RA patients, assessing both accuracy and response speed, while relating them to age, disease-related activity, affective problems, psychomotor speed and other clinical parameters.
   Patients and Methods: The study included 29 RA patients (mean age 50.6 +/- 12.3 years, 79% female) and 30 controls (matched according to age, gender and education), assessed with short-term and working memory tasks from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) and the Automated Working Memory Assessment (AWMA).
   Results: RA patients were significantly slower on the basic processing speed test (Motor Screening Test, p =0.003). Their short-term information storage (verbal and visuospatial) was comparable to controls, yet this similar accuracy came at the expense of a longer response time to retain information correctly (on spatial span, p = 0.04). On tasks with higher executive demands, both visuospatial and verbal working memory were compromised, as RA patients took longer (p = 0.004) and had a higher number of total errors (p = 0.02) when conducting a strategic memory-guided search (Spatial Working Memory), and had a significantly lower verbal working memory span on the backwards digit recall test (p = 0.02).
   Conclusion: The findings of this study emphasize the usefulness of performing computerized tests to detect subtle signs of cognitive impairment and of intact performance, which can inform memory training protocols for this vulnerable population.

TI  - Potentials and Limits of Plasticity Induced by Working Memory Training in Old-Old Age
T2  - GERONTOLOGY
AB  - Background: Old-old age (80+ years) is associated with substantial cognitive decline. In this population, training-induced cognitive plasticity has rarely been studied. While earlier findings on strategy trainings suggested reduced training gains in old-old age, recent results of an extensive process-based working memory (WM) training have been more positive. Objective: Following up on previous research, the present study aimed at examining the effects of a short WM training in old-old adults and the influence of baseline WM capacity on training gains. Methods: A training group (mean age: 86.8 years) and a matched control group (mean age: 87.1 years) participated in the study. The WM training consisted of five tasks that were trained in each of 10 sessions. To evaluate possible transfer effects, executive functions were assessed with two tests before and after training. The training group was divided via median split in high-and low-capacity individuals to determine the influence of baseline WM capacity on training gains. Results: The training group improved in four of the trained tasks (medium-to-large effects). Training gains were significantly larger in the training group than in the control group in only two of those tasks. The training effects were mainly driven by the low-capacity individuals who improved in all trained tasks. No transfer effects were observed. Conclusions: These positive effects of a short WM training, particularly for low-capacity individuals, emphasize the potential for cognitive plasticity in old-old age. The absence of transfer effects may also point to its limits. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel

TI  - Evaluating a frontostriatal working-memory updating-training paradigm in Parkinson's disease: the iPARK trial, a double-blinded randomized controlled trial
T2  - BMC NEUROLOGY
AB  - Background: Cognitive decline and dementia are common in Parkinson's disease (PD). Cognitive deficits have been linked to the depletion of dopamine in the nigrostriatal pathway, but pharmacological treatments for PD have little evidence of improving or delaying cognitive decline. Therefore, exploring non-pharmacological treatment options is important. There have been some promising results of cognitive training interventions in PD, especially for improvements in working memory and executive functions. Yet, existing studies are often underpowered, lacking appropriate control condition, long term follow-up, a thorough description of the intervention and characteristics of the participants. Working memory updating training has previously shown to increase striatal activation in healthy young and old participants as well as dopaminergic neurotransmission in healthy young participants. In the light of dopamine dysfunction in PD, with negative effects on both motor and cognitive functions it is of interest to study if an impaired striatal system can be responsive to a non-invasive, non-pharmacological intervention.
   Methods and design: The iPARK trial is a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial with a parallel-group design that aims to recruit 80 patients with PD (during the period 02/2017-02/2023). Included patients need to have PD, Hoehn and Yahr staging I-III, be between 45 to 75 years of age and not have a diagnosis of dementia. All patients will undergo 30 sessions (6-8 weeks) of web-based cognitive training performed from home. The target intervention is a process-based training program targeting working memory updating. The placebo program is a low dose short-term memory program. A battery of neuropsychological tests and questionnaires will be performed before training, directly after training, and 16 weeks after training.
   Discussion: We expect that the iPARK trial will provide novel and clinically useful information on whether updating training is an effective cognitive training paradigm in PD. Further, it will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of cognitive function in PD and provide answers regarding cognitive plasticity as well as determining critical factors for a responsive striatal system.

TI  - Robotic agents for supporting community-dwelling elderly people with memory complaints: Perceived needs and preferences
T2  - HEALTH INFORMATICS JOURNAL
AB  - Researchers in robotics have been increasingly focusing on robots as a means of supporting older people with cognitive impairment at home. The aim of this study is to explore the elderly's needs and preferences towards having an assistive robot in the home. In order to ensure the appropriateness of this technology, 30 subjects aged 60 and older with memory complaints were recruited from the Memory Clinic of the Broca Hospital. We conducted an interview-administered questionnaire that included questions about their needs and preferences concerning robot functions and modes of action. The subjects reported a desire to retain their capacity to manage their daily activities, to maintain good health and to stimulate their memory. Regarding robot functions, the cognitive stimulation programme earned the highest proportion of positive responses, followed by the safeguarding functions, fall detection and the automatic help call.

TI  - The quest for synergy between physical exercise and cognitive stimulation via exergaming in people with dementia: a randomized controlled trial
T2  - ALZHEIMERS RESEARCH & THERAPY
AB  - BackgroundExercise is often proposed as a non-pharmacological intervention to delay cognitive decline in peoplewith dementia, but evidence remains inconclusive. Previous studies suggest that combining physical exercise with cognitive stimulation may be more successful in this respect. Exergaming is a promising intervention in which physical exercise is combined with cognitively challenging tasks in a single session. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of exergame training and aerobic training on cognitive functioning in older adults with dementia.MethodsA three-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared exergame training, aerobic training and an active control intervention consisting of relaxation and flexibility exercises. Individuals with dementia were randomized and individually trained three times a week during 12weeks. Cognitive functioning was measured at baseline, after the 12-week intervention period and at 24-week follow-up by neuropsychological assessment. The domains of executive function, episodic memory, working memory and psychomotor speed were evaluated. Test scores were converted into standardized z-scores that were averaged per domain. Between-group differences were analysed with analysis of covariance.ResultsData from 115 people with dementia (mean (SD) age=79.2 (6.9) years; mean (SD) MMSE score=22.9 (3.4)) were analysed. There was a significant improvement in psychomotor speed in the aerobic and exergame groups compared to the active control group (mean difference domain score (95% CI) aerobic versus control 0.370 (0.103-0.637), p=0.007; exergame versus control 0.326 (0.081-0.571), p=0.009). The effect size was moderate (partial (2)=0.102). No significant differences between the intervention and control groups were found for executive functioning, episodic memory and working memory.ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first RCT evaluating the effects of exergame training and aerobic training on cognitive functioning in people with dementia. We found that both exergame training and aerobic training improve psychomotor speed, compared to an active control group. This finding may be clinically relevant as psychomotor speed is an important predictor for functional decline. No effects were found on executive function, episodic memory and working memory.Trial registrationNetherlands Trial Register, NTR5581. Registered on 7 October 2015.

TI  - Improved Working Memory Following Novel Combinations of Physical and Cognitive Activity
T2  - NEUROREHABILITATION AND NEURAL REPAIR
AB  - Background. In humans, retrospective studies suggest that habitual physical activity (PA) or cognitive activity (CA) can help maintain or improve cognitive function. Similar findings have been reported using physical exercise in animal studies; however, the exercise paradigms differ markedly in duration and frequency, making extrapolation difficult. Here, the authors present a novel PA and CA paradigm that combines voluntary wheel running with Hebb-Williams and radial arm maze (RAM) training. Methods. A total of 57 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 treatment groups: the PA, CA, and combined PA and CA groups and sedentary controls. PA (voluntary wheel running) and CA (Hebb-Williams mazes) consisted of a moderate 2 h/d, 5 d/wk treatment paradigm. Results. Animals exposed to a combination of PA and CA made significantly fewer working memory errors and exhibited superior choice accuracy when compared with animals exposed to either PA or CA alone in the 8-arm baited configuration of the RAM. Additional analyses revealed that the cognitive improvements were independent of exercise intensity/duration. Assessment of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels revealed a significant increase in hippocampal BDNF only in the PA-alone group. Conclusion. A novel combination of PA and CA improves learning and memory abilities independent of activity intensity, BDNF, or phosphorylated cyclic AMP response element binding protein levels. This is the first report of significant changes in cognitive ability using a paradigm involving moderate levels of PA plus cognitive stimulation. An adaptation of this paradigm may be particularly beneficial in slowing the development of mild cognitive impairment and subsequent dementia in elderly people.

TI  - Does multicomponent physical exercise with simultaneous cognitive training boost cognitive performance in older adults? A 6-month randomized controlled trial with a 1-year follow-up
T2  - CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS IN AGING
AB  - Background: Cognitive impairment is a health problem that concerns almost every second elderly person. Physical and cognitive training have differential positive effects on cognition, but have been rarely applied in combination. This study evaluates synergistic effects of multicomponent physical exercise complemented with novel simultaneous cognitive training on cognition in older adults. We hypothesized that simultaneous cognitive-physical components would add training specific cognitive benefits compared to exclusively physical training.
   Methods: Seniors, older than 70 years, without cognitive impairment, were randomly assigned to either: 1) virtual reality video game dancing (DANCE), 2) treadmill walking with simultaneous verbal memory training (MEMORY), or 3) treadmill walking (PHYS). Each program was complemented with strength and balance exercises. Two 1-hour training sessions per week over 6 months were applied. Cognitive performance was assessed at baseline, after 3 and 6 months, and at 1-year follow-up. Multiple regression analyses with planned comparisons were calculated.
   Results: Eighty-nine participants were randomized to the three groups initially, 71 completed the training, while 47 were available at 1-year follow-up. Advantages of the simultaneous cognitive-physical programs were found in two dimensions of executive function. "Shifting attention" showed a timexintervention interaction in favor of DANCE/MEMORY versus PHYS (F[2, 68]=1.95, trend P=0.075, r=0.17); and "working memory" showed a timexintervention interaction in favor of DANCE versus MEMORY (F[1, 136]=2.71, trend P=0.051, R-2=0.006). Performance improvements in executive functions, long-term visual memory (episodic memory), and processing speed were maintained at follow-up in all groups.
   Conclusion: Particular executive functions benefit from simultaneous cognitive-physical training compared to exclusively physical multicomponent training. Cognitive-physical training programs may counteract widespread cognitive impairments in the elderly.

TI  - Analysis of the effect of a program of cognitive stimulation in elderly people with normal aging in primary care: Randomized clinical
T2  - ATENCION PRIMARIA
AB  - Objective: To provide evidence of the effectiveness of a community health intervention, that includes a cognitive stimulation program, to prevent the deterioration of cognitive abilities in our population of elderly people with normal cognition that are living in the community.
   Design: Randomized clinical trial (CONSORT group norms).
   Location: San Jose Norte-Centro Health Center and La Caridad Foundation (Zaragoza, Spain).
   Participants: 201 people aged 65 or older, with a MEC score of at least 28 points, which were randomized between the Intervention group (101) and the Control group (100).
   Intervention: The intervention was applied in 10 sessions of 45 minutes, one per week. It used materials designed by one of the authors, which addressed the following areas: memory, orientation, language, praxis, gnosis, calculation, perception, logical reasoning, attention-concentration and programming.
   Main measurements: The main outcome variables were MEC, Set-Test, Barthel and Lawton-Brody.
   Results: Increases of the main result variables over their baseline level were analized. For MEC variable, the Intervention group obtained, on average, 1.58 points more than the Control group in the evaluation performed immediately after the intervention. After 6 months, the improvement was 1.51 points and after a year, it was of 2.04 points. All these differences were statistically significant. For Set-Test, Barthel and Lawton-Brody variables, no statistically significant differences were observed between Intervention group and Control group.
   Conclusions: Cognitive stimulation with our program is effective to maintain or improve cognitive performance, measured with the variable MEC, our population of elderly people with normal cognition that are living in the community. There is no evidence that this improvement is transferred to the activities of daily life measured with Barthel and Lawton-Brody variables. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

TI  - Risk- and protective factors for memory plasticity in aging
T2  - AGING NEUROPSYCHOLOGY AND COGNITION
AB  - Risk and protective factors for cognitive function in aging may affect how much individuals benefit from their environment or life experiences by preserving or improving cognitive abilities. We investigated the relations between such factors and outcome from episodic-memory training in 136 healthy young and older adults. Tested risk factors included carrying the e4 variant of the apolipoprotein E allele (APOE), age, body mass index, blood pressure, and cholesterol. Protective factors included higher levels of education, intelligence quotient (IQ), physical activity, fatty acids, and vitamin D. Average increases in memory performance were seen after training, with ample variation between individuals. Being young, female, and having higher IQ were positive predictors of memory improvement. No other relationships were observed. Similar benefit was observed across APOE allelic variation. This indicates that beyond IQ, age, and sex, known risk -and protective factors of cognitive function in aging were not significantly related to memory plasticity.

TI  - Effectiveness of a Multifaceted Cognitive Training Programme for People with Mild Cognitive Impairment: A One-Group Pre- and Posttest Design
T2  - HONG KONG JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY
AB  - Objectives: The effectiveness of a cognitive training programme in enhancing the functional abilities of elderly persons with mild cognitive impairments was tested in an integrated home and institutional training programme focused on performing daily tasks.
   Methods: Twenty elderly participants were taught cognitive stimulation and memory encoding strategies for 10 weeks by an occupational therapist, or by nonprofessionals and community caregivers. The programme consisted of attention and memory stimulation, association-based and imagery-based strategies. Functional assessment (Chinese version of the disability assessment for dementia instrument and the instrumental activities of daily living scale) and neuropsychological tests (digit span forward test, word list memory subtest of the neuropsychological test battery developed by the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease, Cognistat) were administered before and after the programme.
   Results: After the 10-week programme the participants showed significant improvements in average attention and memory. The participants showed improved memory (word list memory: p <= .001) and other cognitive function as measured by the naming (p <= .001), construction (p <= .001), memory (p <= .001) and similarities (p <= .001) subtests of the Cognistat.
   Conclusion: These results provide initial evidence supporting the use of daily tasks as the context in teaching cognitive stimulation and memory encoding strategies to mildly impaired elderly people. Copyright (C) 2012, Elsevier (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - User Participation as a Matter of Care The Configuration of Older Users in the Design of Assistive Technologies
T2  - TECNOSCIENZA-ITALIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY STUDIES
AB  - The participation of older people in technology development is an ambivalent field: while promising a better fit between users and technology, it still is challenging for both the project and for older users. This is particularly the case when older people with cognitive or physical impairments are to be involved. The article examines the configuration of older people as users in the design of a digital memory training for older people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Referring to (feminist) STS, this configuration is conceptualised as a matter of care. Based on an ethnographic field study the article unfolds the spatial, affective, discursive and material practices of user configuration and describes ambivalences and asymmetries in the configuration process that determine the configuration of older people as users in user-centred design.

TI  - Beneficial effects of multisensory and cognitive stimulation on age-related cognitive decline in long-term-care institutions
T2  - CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS IN AGING
AB  - The aim of the present report was to evaluate the effectiveness and impact of multisensory and cognitive stimulation on improving cognition in elderly persons living in long-term-care institutions (institutionalized [I]) or in communities with their families (noninstitutionalized [NI]). We compared neuropsychological performance using language and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) test scores before and after 24 and 48 stimulation sessions. The two groups were matched by age and years of schooling. Small groups of ten or fewer volunteers underwent the stimulation program, twice a week, over 6 months (48 sessions in total). Sessions were based on language and memory exercises, as well as visual, olfactory, auditory, and ludic stimulation, including music, singing, and dance. Both groups were assessed at the beginning (before stimulation), in the middle (after 24 sessions), and at the end (after 48 sessions) of the stimulation program. Although the NI group showed higher performance in all tasks in all time windows compared with I subjects, both groups improved their performance after stimulation. In addition, the improvement was significantly higher in the I group than the NI group. Language tests seem to be more efficient than the MMSE to detect early changes in cognitive status. The results suggest the impoverished environment of long-term-care institutions may contribute to lower cognitive scores before stimulation and the higher improvement rate of this group after stimulation. In conclusion, language tests should be routinely adopted in the neuropsychological assessment of elderly subjects, and long-term-care institutions need to include regular sensorimotor, social, and cognitive stimulation as a public health policy for elderly persons.

TI  - A Set of High Name Agreement Pictures for Evaluation and Therapy of Language and Cognitive Deficits
T2  - CESKA A SLOVENSKA NEUROLOGIE A NEUROCHIRURGIE
AB  - Objectives: Pictures are a popular tool for cognitive testing, memory training and speech therapy. However, a picture that can be termed in different ways can result in controversial interpretations. The correct naming of a picture depends on linguistic characteristics of the language (e.g. frequency and length of words), the drawing itself (how well it depicts the object), age, diagnosis and other factors. Therefore, we decided to form a file of pictures, obtain drawings and then select those with high level of name agreement (> 90%) in healthy seniors. Patients with Alzheimer's disease may vary in their ability to term a picture. Therefore, another aim of this research was to rank the pictures according to the grade of difficulty associated with their naming by patients with Alzheimer's disease. Subjects and methods: Different cohorts of healthy elderly repeatedly named two-dimensional line drawings from 10 categories: animals, tools, clothes, fruits, vegetables, body parts, plants; means of transport, food, musical instruments. The pictures were redrawn, added or eliminated in eight consecutive steps. The final quality screening of 70 pictures from the seventh Set was carried out in 76 healthy seniors (age 78 +/- 7 years) and 57 patients with Alzheimer's disease (age 81 +/- 5 years, MMSE 22 +/- 5 points). Results: The final set comprises 66 pictures in various semantic categories and with name agreement more than 90%. The graded naming difficulty was assessed by the difference in naming agreement between healthy elderly and patients with Alzheimer's disease. The pictures were divided into three groups: difficult (n = 13), moderate (n = 14) and easy (n = 40). Drawings showing hippopotamus, pretzel and walrus were the most difficult to name for AD patients. Conclusion: The full final set contains pictures with different degrees of difficulty. Each has its own semantic category and is named by one Czech word with high level of name agreement. They are suitable for multiple purposes.

TI  - Effects of a memory training program in older people with severe memory loss
T2  - EDUCATIONAL GERONTOLOGY
AB  - Strategies based memory training programs are widely used to enhance the cognitive abilities of the elderly. Participants in these training programs are usually people whose mental abilities remain intact. Occasionally, people with cognitive impairment also participate. The aim of this study was to test if memory training designed specifically for healthy people is effective in people with severe memory impairment. We carried out a 10-year retrospective case-control study with Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT) and memory complaint measures obtained pre-post training. The case group consisted of 73 people with memory impairment (IM group). The control group (n=72) was made of individuals with preserved memory and sociodemographic characteristics similar to the case group (PM group). Both groups improved their performance on everyday memory tasks (measured using the RBMT). The IM group improved more than the PM group in everyday memory tasks, especially in prospective memory tasks. Both groups also reduced their level of subjective complaints as a result of training. In conclusion, our results are encouraging with respect to the efficacy of comprehensive memory training programs for older people with severe memory impairment.

TI  - Memory Training Program Decreases the Circulating Level of Cortisol and Pro-inflammatory Cytokines in Healthy Older Adults
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Aging cognitive decline has been associated to impairment of the Hypothalamus Pituitary Adrenals (HPA) axis activity and a higher level of the systemic inflammation. However, little is known about the molecules driving this process at peripheral level. In addition, the cognitive function is to some extent modifiable with Memory Training (MT) programs, even among older adults and beyond. The study aims to evaluate whether MT could contribute to ameliorate cognitive performance and modulate the HPA axis activity as well the low level inflammation in the aging phenotype. Whether the phosphatase WIP-1, a negative regulator for inflammation, is involved in this process was also investigated. We recruited 31 young adults (19-28, years of age) and 62 older adults aged over 60. Thirty-two older adults were submitted to 6-months of MT program (EG), and 28 older adults were no treated and used as Control Group (CG). Global cognitive functioning (MMSE score), verbal and visual memory, and attention were assessed at baseline (T0) and after 6-months (T1). At the same time, plasmatic level of Cortisol (C), IL-1 beta, IL-18, IL-6, and the expression of WIP-1 mRNA and protein in ex vivo Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells were analyzed in young adults at T0, as well in older adults at T0 and T1. Together, the results suggest that MT improves the global cognitive functionality, verbal and visual memory, as well as the level of attention. At the same time we observed a decrease of the plasmatic level of C, of the cytokines, and an increase of the expression of mRNA and protein of WIP-1. The analysis of correlations highlighted that the level of the mRNA of WIP-1 was positively associated to the MMSE score, and negatively to the C and cytokine levels. In conclusion, we purpose the MT as tool that could help support successful aging through the improving of memory, attention and global cognitive function performance. Furthermore, this approach could participate to maintain lower the peripheral levels of the C and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The WIP-1 as a potential new target of the pathophysiology of aging is theorized.

TI  - Cognitive Stimulation of Elderly Individuals with Instrumental Virtual Reality-Based Activities of Daily Life: Pre-Post Treatment Study
T2  - CYBERPSYCHOLOGY BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL NETWORKING
AB  - As the demographic structure in western societies ages, the prevalence and impact of cognitive decline rises. Thus, new solutions to tackle this problem are required. The use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)-based cognitive exercises has emerged in the last few decades, though with inconsistent results. Hence, we conducted a pre-post treatment study to further investigate this approach. We designed a set of virtual reality exercises that mimic activities of daily living by which the patient can train different cognitive domains. Twenty-five participants, ages 65-85, underwent 12 training sessions between the pre-treatment and post-treatment assessments. Significant increases were seen between the two assessments for some of the neuropsychological measures: visual memory, attention, and cognitive flexibility. Results also suggest that participants with lower baseline cognitive performance levels improved most after these sessions.

TI  - Approach to the forgetful patient
T2  - SINGAPORE MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Singapore has an ageing population with a projected 53,000 people aged >= 60 years living with dementia by 2020. Primary care doctors have the opportunity to initiate early work-up for reversible causes of cognitive dysfunction, allowing identification of comorbidities and discussion of medical therapy options. Early diagnosis confers the sick role on the patient, which allays frustration and explains events and behaviour that may have strained relationships with family and friends. The patient can be encouraged to plan for future health and personal care options with a Lasting Power of Attorney and/or Advance Care Planning. Objective cognitive tests (e.g. abbreviated mental test and Mini-Mental State Examination) and brain imaging are adjuncts that help in formulating the diagnosis. Referral to a hospital memory clinic activates a multidisciplinary team approach to dementia, including clinical consultation, dementia counselling, physiotherapy sessions on gait/fall prevention, occupational therapy sessions on cognitive stimulation and caregiver training.

TI  - Evaluation of a computer-assisted errorless learning-based memory training program for patients with early Alzheimer's disease in Hong Kong: a pilot study
T2  - CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS IN AGING
AB  - Background: Improving the situation in older adults with cognitive decline and evidence of cognitive rehabilitation is considered crucial in long-term care of the elderly. The objective of this study was to implement a computerized errorless learning-based memory training program (CELP) for persons with early Alzheimer's disease, and to compare the training outcomes of a CELP group with those of a therapist-led errorless learning program (TELP) group and a waiting-list control group.
   Methods: A randomized controlled trial with a single-blind research design was used in the study. Chinese patients with early Alzheimer's disease screened by the Clinical Dementia Rating (score of 1) were recruited. The subjects were randomly assigned to CELP (n = 6), TELP (n = 6), and waiting-list control (n = 7) groups. Evaluation of subjects before and after testing, and at three-month follow-up was achieved using primary outcomes on the Chinese Mini-Mental State Examination, Chinese Dementia Rating Scale, Hong Kong List Learning Test, and the Brief Assessment of Prospective Memory-Short Form. Secondary outcomes were the Modified Barthel Index, Hong Kong Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, and Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form. The data were analyzed using Friedman's test for time effect and the Kruskal-Wallis test for treatment effect.
   Results: Positive treatment effects on cognition were found in two errorless learning-based memory groups (ie, computer-assisted and therapist-led). Remarkable changes were shown in cognitive function for subjects receiving CELP and emotional/daily functions in those receiving TELP.
   Conclusion: Positive changes in the cognitive function of Chinese patients with early Alzheimer's disease were initially found after errorless training through CELP. Further enhancement of the training program is recommended.

TI  - In aged rats, differences in spatial learning and memory influence the response to late-life Environmental Enrichment
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL GERONTOLOGY
AB  - YIt has clearly been demonstrated that cognitive stimulation, physical exercise, and social engagement help counteract age-related cognitive decline. However, several important issues remain to be addressed. Given the wide differences in cognitive impairment found among individuals of the same age, identifying the subjects who will benefit most from late-life interventions is one such issue. Environmental Enrichment (EE) is a particularly valuable approach to do this. In this study, aged (21-month-old) rats were assigned to a better (BL) or a worse (WL) learner group (training phase) and to a non-impaired (NI) or an impaired (I) group (probe phase) by their performance on the Morris Water Maze, using the test performances of adult (12-month-old) rats as the cut-offs. The aged rats were retested after a 12-week EE or standard housing (SH) protocol. After 12 weeks, the performances of SH rats had deteriorated, whereas all rats benefited from EE, albeit in different ways. In particular, the animals assigned to the BL and the NI groups prior to EE still performed as well as the adult rats (performance preservation) whereas, critically, the animals assigned to the WL and the I groups before EE showed such improved performances that they reached the level of the adult rats (performance improvement), despite having aged further. EE seems to induce the preservation in BLs and the improvement in WLs of spatial search strategies and the preservation in NIs and the increase in Is of a focused and protract research of the escape point. Our findings suggest that late-life EE prevents spatial learning and memory decline in still cognitively preserved animals and stimulates residual functional reserve in already cognitively compromised animals. Future research should focus on individually tailored stimulation protocols to improve their effect and afford a better understanding of the underlying processes.

TI  - Neuronal and behavioral effects of multi-day brain stimulation and memory training
T2  - NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING
AB  - Strategies for memory enhancement, especially for the older population, are of great scientific and public interest. Here, we aimed at investigating neuronal and behavioral effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) paired with memory training. Young and older adults were trained on an object-location-memory task on 3 consecutive days with either anodal or sham tDCS. Recall performance was assessed immediately after training, 1 day and 1 month later, as well as performance on trained function and transfer task. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was conducted at baseline and at 1-day follow-up to analyze functional coupling in the default mode network. Anodal tDCS led to superior recall performance after training, an associated increase in default mode network strength and enhanced trained function and transfer after 1 month. Our findings suggest that tDCS-accompanied multi-day training improves performance on trained material, is associated with beneficial memory network alterations, and transfers to other memory tasks. Our study provides insight into tDCS-induced behavioral and neuronal alterations and will help to develop interventions against age-related cognitive decline. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Investigating the Effects of Spacing on Working Memory Training Outcome: A Randomized, Controlled, Multisite Trial in Older Adults
T2  - JOURNALS OF GERONTOLOGY SERIES B-PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB  - Objective: The majority of the population will experience some cognitive decline with age. Therefore, the development of effective interventions to mitigate age-related decline is critical for older adults' cognitive functioning and their quality of life.
   Methods: In our randomized controlled multisite trial, we target participants' working memory (WM) skills, and in addition, we focus on the intervention's optimal scheduling in order to test whether and how the distribution of training sessions might affect task learning, and ultimately, transfer. Healthy older adults completed an intervention targeting either WM or general knowledge twice per day, once per day, or once every-other-day. Before and after the intervention and 3 months after training completion, participants were tested in a variety of cognitive domains, including those representing functioning in everyday life.
   Results: In contrast to our hypotheses, spacing seems to affect learning only minimally. We did observe some transfer effects, especially within the targeted cognitive domain (WM and inhibition/interference), which remained stable at the 3-month follow-up.
   Discussion: Our findings have practical implications by showing that the variation in training schedule, at least within the range used here, does not seem to be a crucial element for training benefits.

TI  - Repeated cognitive stimulation alleviates memory impairments in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model
T2  - BRAIN RESEARCH BULLETIN
AB  - Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease associated with progressive memory and cognitive decline. Previous studies have identified the benefits of cognitive enrichment on reducing disease pathology. Additionally, epidemiological and clinical data suggest that repeated exercise, and cognitive and social enrichment, can improve and/or delay the cognitive deficiencies associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study, 3xTg-AD mice were exposed to a rigorous training routine beginning at 3 months of age, which consisted of repeated training in the Morris water maze spatial recognition task every 3 months, ending at 18 months of age. At the conclusion of the final Morris water maze training session, animals subsequently underwent testing in another hippocampus-dependent spatial task, the Barnes maze task, and on the more cortical-dependent novel object recognition memory task. Our data show that periodic cognitive enrichment throughout aging, via multiple learning episodes in the Morris water maze task, can improve the memory performance of aged 3xTg-AD mice in a separate spatial recognition task, and in a preference memory task, when compared to naive aged matched 3xTg-AD mice. Furthermore, we observed that the cognitive enrichment properties of Morris water maze exposer, was detectable in repeatedly trained animals as early as 6 months of age. These findings suggest early repeated cognitive enrichment can mitigate the diverse cognitive deficits observed in Alzheimer's disease. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Spatial training preserves associative memory capacity with augmentation of dendrite ramification and spine generation in Tg2576 mice
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and there is currently no efficient cure for this devastating disease. Cognitive stimulation can delay memory loss during aging and in patients with mild cognitive impairment. In 3 x Tg-AD mice, training decreased the neuropathologies with transient amelioration of memory decline. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the learning-improved memory capacity are poorly understood. Here, we found in Tg2576 mice spatial training in Morris water maze (MWM) remarkably improved the subsequent associative memory acquisition detected by contextual fear conditioning. We also found that spatial training enhanced long term potentiation, dendrite ramification and spine generation in hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and CA1 neurons at 24 h after the training. In the molecular level, the MWM training remarkably activated calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) with elevation of glutamate AMPA receptor GluA1 subunit (GluA1), postsynaptic density protein 93 (PSD93) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) in the hippocampus. Finally, the training also significantly ameliorated AD-like tau and amyloid pathologies. We conclude that spatial training in MWM preserves associative memory capacity in Tg2576 mice, and the mechanisms involve augmentation of dendrite ramification and spine generation in hippocampus.

TI  - Effects of system response delays on elderly humans' cognitive performance in a virtual training scenario
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Observed influences of system response delay in spoken human-machine dialogues are rather ambiguous and mainly focus on perceived system quality. Studies that systematically inspect effects on cognitive performance are still lacking, and effects of individual characteristics are also often neglected. Building on benefits of cognitive training for decelerating cognitive decline, this Wizard-of-Oz study addresses both issues by testing 62 elderly participants in a dialogue-based memory training with a virtual agent. Participants acquired the method of loci with fading instructional guidance and applied it afterward to memorizing and recalling lists of German nouns. System response delays were randomly assigned, and training performance was included as potential mediator. Participants' age, gender, and subscales of affinity for technology (enthusiasm, competence, positive and negative perception of technology) were inspected as potential moderators. The results indicated positive effects on recall performance with higher training performance, female gender, and less negative perception of technology. Additionally, memory retention and facets of affinity for technology moderated increasing system response delays. Participants also provided higher ratings in perceived system quality with higher enthusiasm for technology but reported increasing frustration with a more positive perception of technology. Potential explanations and implications for the design of spoken dialogue systems are discussed.

TI  - A Larger Social Network Enhances Novel Object Location Memory and Reduces Hippocampal Microgliosis in Aged Mice
T2  - FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - The mammalian hippocampus shows marked decline in function with aging across many species, including humans and laboratory rodent models. This decline frequently manifests in memory impairments that occur even in the absence of dementia pathology. In humans, a number of factors correlate with preserved hippocampal memory in aging, such as exercise, cognitive stimulation and number of social ties. While interventional studies and animal models clearly indicate that exercise and cognitive stimulation lead to hippocampal preservation, there is relatively little research on whether a decline in social ties leads to cognitive decline or vice versa. Even in animal studies of environmental enrichment in aging, the focus typically falls on physical enrichment such as a rotating cast of toys, rather than the role of social interactions. The present studies investigated the hypothesis that a greater number of social ties in aging mice would lead to improved hippocampal function. Aged, female C57/Bl6 mice were housed for 3 months in pairs or large groups (7 mice per cage). Group-housed mice showed greater novel object location memory and stronger preference for a spatial navigation strategy in the Barnes maze, though no difference in escape latency, compared to pair-housed mice. Group-housed mice did not differ from pair-housed mice in basal corticosterone levels or adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Group-housed mice did, however, show reduced numbers of Iba1/CD68+ microglia in the hippocampus. These findings suggest that group housing led to better memory function and reduced markers of neuroinflammation in aged mice. More broadly, they support a causative link between social ties and hippocampal function, suggesting that merely having a larger social network can positively influence the aging brain. Future research should address the molecular mechanisms by which a greater number of social ties alters hippocampal function.

TI  - Neural Evidence of Superior Memory: How to Capture Brain Activities of Encoding Processes Underlying Superior Memory
T2  - FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Relatively little attention has been paid to the neural basis of superior memory despite its potential in providing important insight into efforts to improve memory in the general population or to offset age-related cognitive decline. The current study reports a rare opportunity to reproduce and isolate specific neural activities directly associated with exceptional memory. To capture the brain processes responsible for superior memory, we returned to a laboratory task and analytic approach used to explore the nature of exceptional memory, namely, digit-span task combined with verbal protocol analysis. One participant with average memory received approximately 50 h of digit-span training and the participant's digit-span increased from normative (8 digits) to exceptional (30 digits). Event-related potentials were recorded while the participant's digit span increased from 19 to 30 digits. Protocol analysis allowed us to identify direct behavioral indices of idiosyncratic encoding processes underlying the superior memory performance. EEG indices directly corresponding to the behavioral indices of encoding processes were identified. The results suggest that the early attention-related encoding processes were reflected in theta and delta whereas the later attention-independent encoding processes were reflected in time-domain slow-wave. This fine-grained approach offers new insights into studying neural mechanism mediating superior memory and the cognitive effort necessary to develop it.

TI  - Cognitive Impairment in the 3xTg-AD Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease is Affected by A beta-ImmunoTherapy and Cognitive Stimulation
T2  - PHARMACEUTICS
AB  - Clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) include behavioral alterations and cognitive impairment. These functional phenotypes early occur in triple-transgenic (3xTg-AD) mice. Specifically, behavioral alterations are first detected when mice are at around 2.5 months old and cognitive impairment in between 3- and 5-month-old mice. In this work, the effect of chronic A beta-immunotherapy on behavioral and cognitive abilities was tested by monthly administering the antibody fragment scFv-h3D6 to 3xTg-AD female mice from 5 to 9 months of age. An untreated group was used as a reference, as well as to attain some information on the effect of training during the longitudinal study. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD)-like symptoms were already evident in 5-month-old mice, in the form of neophobia and anxious-like behavior. The exploratory activity decreased over the longitudinal study, not only for 3xTgAD mice but also for the corresponding non-transgenic mice (NTg). Learning abilities of 3xTg-AD mice were not seriously compromised but an impairment in long-term spatial memory was evident at 5 months of age. Interestingly, scFv-h3D6-treatment affected the cognitive impairment displayed by 5-month-old 3xTg-AD mice. It is worth noting that training also reduced cognitive impairment of 3xTg-AD mice over the longitudinal study, suggesting that to properly quantify the isolated therapeutic potential of any drug on cognition using this model it is convenient to perform a prompt, age-matched study rather than a longitudinal study. In addition, a combination of both training and A beta-immunotherapy could constitute a possible approach to treat Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - Improvement in Memory with Plasticity-Based Adaptive Cognitive Training: Results of the 3-Month Follow-Up
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN GERIATRICS SOCIETY
AB  - OBJECTIVES
   To investigate maintenance of training effects of a novel brain plasticity-based computerized cognitive training program in older adults after a 3-month no-contact period.
   DESIGN
   Multisite, randomized, controlled, double-blind trial with two treatment groups.
   SETTING
   Communities in northern and southern California and Minnesota.
   PARTICIPANTS
   Four hundred eighty-seven community-dwelling adults aged 65 and older without diagnosis of clinically significant cognitive impairment.
   INTERVENTION
   Random assignment into a broadly available brain plasticity-based computerized cognitive training program experimental group or a novelty- and intensity-matched cognitive stimulation active control. Assessments at baseline, after training, and at 3 months.
   MEASUREMENTS
   The primary outcome was a composite of auditory subtests of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. Secondary measures included trained task performance, standardized neuropsychological assessments of overall memory and attention, and participant-reported outcomes (PROs).
   RESULTS
   A significant difference in improvement from baseline to 3-month follow-up was seen between the experimental training and control groups on the secondary composite of overall memory and attention, (P=.01, d=0.25), the trained processing-speed measure (P <.001, d=0.80), word list total recall (P=.004, d=0.28), letter-number sequencing (P=.003, d=0.29), and the cognitive subscale of PRO (P=.006, d=0.27). Previously significant improvements became nonsignificant at the 3-month follow-up for the primary outcome, two secondary measures of attention and memory, and several PROs. Narrative memory continued to show no advantage for the experimental group. Effect sizes from baseline to follow-up were generally smaller than effect sizes from baseline to posttraining.
   CONCLUSION
   Training effects were maintained but waned over the 3-month no-contact period.

TI  - Dual-Task Exercise to Improve Cognition and Functional Capacity of Healthy Older Adults
T2  - FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Background: It has been suggested that physical inactivity and lack of stimulating cognitive activity are the two most significant modifiable risk factors to impair cognitive function. Although many studies that investigated the cognitive effects of physical exercise and cognitive stimuli in dual-task conditions showed improved cognitive performance, others have not confirmed these findings. The main aim of the present work is to analyze the effects of a dual-task multimodal physical exercise training, at moderate intensity, and cognitive stimulation on cognitive and physical function in healthy older adults.
   Methods: This clinical trial was registered on the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (RBR-9zrx3d). Here we tested the effects of a dual-task multimodal physical exercise training, at moderate intensity, on cognitive and physical function and quality of life in community dwelling older adults. The training protocol included 24 group sessions, 2/week, per 75 min. Cognition was assessed using CANTAB automated neuropsychological tests and Functional Capacity to Exercise tests. Performance was compared from baseline to post intervention and to a non-exercise control group using Mixed Linear Model for repeated measures.
   Results: Control (CG) and dual-task (DTEx) groups progressed differentially over time on performance of episodic memory, sustained visual attention, functional mobility, cardiorespiratory fitness, lower limbs strength resistance, agility, quality of life and dualtask performance with significant improved DTEx performance. Control group did not show any significant changes on these tests except for showing a reduction in dual-task performance.
   Conclusion: We suggest that the dual-task combination of multisensory cognitive stimulation and multimodal moderate physical exercise training, twice a week, may be adopted as an effective program to reduce progression of age-related cognitive decline and improve physical fitness and quality of life on healthy older adults.

TI  - Multicomponent physical exercise with simultaneous cognitive training to enhance dual-task walking of older adults: a secondary analysis of a 6-month randomized controlled trial with 1-year follow-up
T2  - CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS IN AGING
AB  - Background: About one-third of people older than 65 years fall at least once a year. Physical exercise has been previously demonstrated to improve gait, enhance physical fitness, and prevent falls. Nonetheless, the addition of cognitive training components may potentially increase these effects, since cognitive impairment is related to gait irregularities and fall risk. We hypothesized that simultaneous cognitive-physical training would lead to greater improvements in dual-task (DT) gait compared to exclusive physical training.
   Methods: Elderly persons older than 70 years and without cognitive impairment were randomly assigned to the following groups: 1) virtual reality video game dancing (DANCE), 2) treadmill walking with simultaneous verbal memory training (MEMORY), or 3) treadmill walking (PHYS). Each program was complemented with strength and balance exercises. Two 1-hour training sessions per week over 6 months were applied. Gait variables, functional fitness (Short Physical Performance Battery, 6-minute walk), and fall frequencies were assessed at baseline, after 3 months and 6 months, and at 1-year follow-up. Multiple regression analyses with planned comparisons were carried out.
   Results: Eighty-nine participants were randomized to three groups initially; 71 completed the training and 47 were available at 1-year follow-up. DANCE/MEMORY showed a significant advantage compared to PHYS in DT costs of step time variability at fast walking (P=0.044). Training-specific gait adaptations were found on comparing DANCE and MEMORY: DANCE reduced step time at fast walking (P=0.007) and MEMORY reduced gait variability in DT and DT costs at preferred walking speed (both trend P=0.062). Global linear time effects showed improved gait (P<0.05), functional fitness (P<0.05), and reduced fall frequency (-77%, P<0.001). Only single-task fast walking, gait variability at preferred walking speed, and Short Physical Performance Battery were reduced at follow-up (all P<0.05 or trend).
   Conclusion: Long-term multicomponent cognitive-physical and exclusive physical training programs demonstrated similar potential to counteract age-related decline in physical functioning.

TI  - The Age Effects on the Cognitive Processes of Intention-Based and Stimulus-Based Actions: An ERP Study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - The functional decline in action among older adults is caused not only by physical weakness but also by cognitive decline. In this study, we aimed to compare the cognitive effects of age between intention-based and stimulus-based action modes electrophysiologically. Because age-related declines in cognitive function might proceed distinctly according to specific action modes and processes, four specific cognitive processes, action-effect binding, stimulus-response linkage, action-effect feedback control, and effect-action retrieval, were investigated. We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) during a modified acquisition-test paradigm in young (mean age = 21, SD = 2) and old (mean age = 69, SD = 5) groups. A temporal bisection task and a movement pre-cuing task were used during the acquisition and test phases, respectively. Using ERP indices including readiness potential (RP), P3, N2 and contingent negative variation (CNV) to identify these four specific processes for the two action modes, we revealed the effects of age on each ERP index. The results showed similar patterns of waveforms but consistently decreasing amplitudes of all four ERP indices in the old age group compared with the young age group, which indicates not only generally declining functions of action preparation in older adults but also age effects specific to the action modes and processes that might otherwise be mixed together under confounding experimental conditions. Particularly, an interference effect indexed by the differences in the amplitudes of CNV between congruent and incongruent tasks was observed in the young age group, which is consistent with previous behavioral reports. However, this effect was absent in the old age group, indicating a specific age-related deficit in the effect-action retrieval process of intention-based action, which might be caused by an age-related deficit in associative memory. In sum, this study investigated the cognitive processes of two action modes from a developmental perspective and suggests the importance of adding associative memory training to interventions for older adults with the aim of improving intention-based action.

TI  - Crtc1 Activates a Transcriptional Program Deregulated at Early Alzheimer's Disease-Related Stages
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Cognitive decline is associated with gene expression changes in the brain, but the transcriptional mechanisms underlying memory impairments in cognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), are largely unknown. Here, we aimed to elucidate relevant mechanisms responsible for transcriptional changes underlying early memory loss in AD by examining pathological, behavioral, and transcriptomic changes in control and mutant beta-amyloid precursor protein(APP(Sw,Ind)) transgenic mice during aging. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis using mouse microarrays revealed deregulation of a gene network related with neuro transmission, synaptic plasticity, and learning/ memory in the hippocampus of APP(Sw,Ind) mice after spatial memory training. Specifically, APPSw, Ind mice show changes on a cAMP-responsive element binding protein(CREB)regulated transcriptional program dependent on the CREB-regulated transcription coactivator-1 (Crtc1). Interestingly, synaptic activity and spatial memory induces Crtc1 dephosphorylation (Ser151), nuclear translocation, and Crtc1-dependent transcription in the hippocampus, and these events are impaired in APPSw, Ind mice at early pathological and cognitive decline stages. CRTC1-dependent genes and CRTC1 levels are reduced in human hippocampus at intermediate Braak III/IV pathological stages. Importantly, adeno-associated viral-mediated Crtc1 overexpression in the hippocampus efficiently reverses A beta-induced spatial learning and memory deficits by restoring a specific subset of Crtc1 target genes. Our results reveal a critical role of Crtc1-dependent transcription on spatial memory formation and provide the first evidence that targeting brain transcriptome reverses memory loss in AD.

TI  - A Brain-Computer Interface Based Cognitive Training System for Healthy Elderly: A Randomized Control Pilot Study for Usability and Preliminary Efficacy
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Cognitive decline in aging is a pressing issue associated with significant healthcare costs and deterioration in quality of life. Previously, we reported the successful use of a novel brain-computer interface (BCI) training system in improving symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Here, we examine the feasibility of the BCI system with a new game that incorporates memory training in improving memory and attention in a pilot sample of healthy elderly. This study investigates the safety, usability and acceptability of our BCI system to elderly, and obtains an efficacy estimate to warrant a phase III trial. Thirty-one healthy elderly were randomized into intervention (n = 15) and waitlist control arms (n = 16). Intervention consisted of an 8-week training comprising 24 half-hour sessions. A usability and acceptability questionnaire was administered at the end of training. Safety was investigated by querying users about adverse events after every session. Efficacy of the system was measured by the change of total score from the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) before and after training. Feedback on the usability and acceptability questionnaire was positive. No adverse events were reported for all participants across all sessions. Though the median difference in the RBANS change scores between arms was not statistically significant, an effect size of 0.6SD was obtained, which reflects potential clinical utility according to Simon's randomized phase II trial design. Pooled data from both arms also showed that the median change in total scores pre and post-training was statistically significant (Mdn = 4.0; p<0.001). Specifically, there were significant improvements in immediate memory (p = 0.038), visuospatial/constructional (p = 0.014), attention (p = 0.039), and delayed memory (p<0.001) scores. Our BCI-based system shows promise in improving memory and attention in healthy elderly, and appears to be safe, user-friendly and acceptable to senior users. Given the efficacy signal, a phase III trial is warranted.

TI  - Unawareness of memory impairment and behavioral abnormalities in patients with Alzheimer's disease: Relation to professional health care burden
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUTRITION HEALTH & AGING
AB  - The present study investigates the impact of unawareness of deficit (anosognosia) in patients with Alzheimer's disease upon professional health care burden.
   Cross-sectional study with a consecutive clinical sample from an Alzheimer day-care hospital in France.
   65 patients with probable AD, aged from 75 to 94 years old, consecutively admitted at the Alzheimer Day Hospital to complete a program of cognitive stimulation and psychosocial rehabilitation.
   Bach patient was submitted to a standardized evaluation including clinical investigation, cerebral imagery, and neuropsychological assessment. Anosognosia of memory deficit and anosognosia of behavioral disturbances were measured as the "discrepancy-scores" between patients' self-reports and family member ratings of patient memory performance and behavioral disturbances. Professional health care burden was assessed with the Professional Health Care Dementia Burden Index (PCDBI; maximal score: 12), designed for this study. Multiple linear regressions were used to examine the correlations between the PCDBI and the severity of anosognosia.
   The findings showed a significant positive correlation between the PCDBI and both anosognosia of memory impairment and behavioral abnormalities (both p at least less than 0.05). However, there was no significant correlation between the severity of the burden and the severity of cognitive decline or functional impairment (both p at least > 0.05).
   Anosognosia in Alzheimer disease patients has a negative impact upon the professional caregivers' burden over and above the cognitive deficit and the functional impairments.

TI  - Effects of Long-Term Environmental Enrichment on Anxiety, Memory, Hippocampal Plasticity and Overall Brain Gene Expression in C57BL6 Mice
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - There is ample evidence that physical activity exerts positive effects on a variety of brain functions by facilitating neuroprotective processes and influencing neuroplasticity. Accordingly, numerous studies have shown that continuous exercise can successfully diminish or prevent the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease in transgenic mouse models. However, the long-term effect of physical activity on brain health of aging wild-type (WT) mice has not yet been studied in detail. Here, we show that prolonged physical and cognitive stimulation, mediated by an enriched environment (FE) paradigm for a duration of 11 months, leads to reduced anxiety and improved spatial reference memory in C57BL6 WT mice. While the number of CA1 pyramidal neurons remained unchanged between standard housed (SH) and EE mice, the number of dentate gyrus (DG) neurons, as well as the CA1 and DG volume were significantly increased in FE mice. A whole-brain deep sequencing transcriptome analysis, carried out to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed effects, revealed an up-regulation of a variety of genes upon EE, mainly associated with synaptic plasticity and transcription regulation. The present findings corroborate the impact of continuous physical activity as a potential prospective route in the prevention of age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders.

TI  - Mobile Games Individualise and Motivate Rehabilitation in Different User Groups
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GAME-BASED LEARNING
AB  - Trials on Mobile Games are presenting a huge potential in cognitive, physical and mental rehabilitation. This paper is to discuss user viewpoints of trials with mobile games combining cognitive stimulation and physical exercise in rehabilitation: Game#1 controlled by tilting the mobile phone embedded in a balance board; Game#2 controlled by tilting the tablet pc; and Game#3 a modified game version of Trail Making A - memory test played by tapping figures on the tablet pc touch screen. The total amount of participants was 89 of which 74% were older adults (women=24; men=33; average age 85.9 years) and 26% people with learning disabilities (n=23; a 38.9 years). The gameplay setting was similar for all target groups, although the game graphics (Game#1) were slightly modified based on each user group. Mobile devices were used as the game platform to create easily approachable games of low costs and suitable for the majority of people.

TI  - Role of Kalirin and mouse strain in retention of spatial memory training in an Alzheimer's disease model mouse line
T2  - NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING
AB  - Nontransgenic and 3xTG transgenic mice, which express mutant transgenes encoding human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) along with Alzheimer's disease-associated versions of hTau and a presenilin mutation, acquired the Barnes Maze escape task equivalently at 3-9 months of age. Although nontransgenics retested at 6 and 9 months acquired the escape task more quickly than naive mice, 3xTG mice did not. Deficits in Kalirin, a multidomain protein scaffold and guanine nucleotide exchange factor that regulates dendritic spines, has been proposed as a contributor to the cognitive decline observed in Alzheimer's disease. To test whether deficits in Kalirin might amplify deficits in 3xTG mice, mice heterozygous/hemizygous for Kalirin and the 3xTG transgenes were generated. Mouse strain, age and sex affected cortical expression of key proteins. hAPP levels in 3xTG mice increased total APP levels at all ages. Kalirin expression showed strong sex-dependent expression in C57 but not B6129 mice. Decreasing Kalirin levels to half had no effect on Barnes Maze task acquisition or retraining in 3xTG hemizygous mice. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Cuba's Strategy for Alzheimer Disease and Dementia Syndromes
T2  - MEDICC REVIEW
AB  - Dementia is a great challenge to public health in Cuba due to its impact on society and families. Cuba's National Intervention Strategy for Alzheimer Disease and Dementia Syndromes is designed to address this challenge. The Strategy includes working guidelines for primary and secondary care, education about rights of people with cognitive impairment, professional development, research, and health promotion and dementia prevention. An associated action plan, focused on primary care, includes proposals for creation of memory clinics, day centers and comprehensive rehabilitation services for cognitive stimulation. Short-term measures proposed include increasing early detection; creating a dementia morbidity and mortality registry; promoting professional training; providing support for families; and promoting basic and clinical research on dementia. Medium-term proposals aim to reduce dementia incidence and mortality by controlling risk factors and promoting healthy lifestyles, offering new treatment options and optimizing early detection. A set of indicators has been developed to evaluate strategy implementation. With this strategy, Cuba joins the small number of developing countries that have responded to WHO's call to improve care for patients with dementia and alleviate its impact on society and families.

TI  - Cognitive activity for the treatment of older adults with mild Alzheimer's Disease (AD) - PACE AD: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial
T2  - TRIALS
AB  - Background: Participation in cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) may reduce the rate of cognitive decline in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD), however it is unclear if the training of carers to deliver activities is sufficient to improve the clinical outcome of patients. The Promoting Healthy Ageing with Cognitive Exercise for Alzheimer's Disease (PACE-AD) study has been designed to determine if change in cognitive function over a six month period can be achieved with participation in cognitive stimulating activities when the intervention is delivered to carers only as opposed to carers and patients.
   Methods/Design: The study will aim to recruit 128 community-dwelling men and women with probable AD according to NINCDS-ADRDS criteria. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of two cognitive activity treatment groups: (1) Participants with mild AD and their companions together (2) Companions of participants with mild AD alone. The intervention will consist of a twelve-week program of cognitive stimulation. Seven weeks of the program will involve 90-minute group sessions delivered once per week while the remaining weeks of the program will involve structured home based activities with telephone support. The primary outcome measure of the study is the change from baseline in the total score on the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-COG). Secondary outcomes of interest include changes in health related quality of life, mood, memory, language, executive functions, independent living abilities and psychiatric symptoms for participants with mild AD. Changes in companion quality of life, mood, and general health will also be monitored. Primary endpoints will be collected 13 and 26 weeks after the baseline assessment.
   Discussion: The proposed project will provide evidence as to whether CST for people with AD and their companions is more beneficial than when used for companions alone. Outcomes sought include a reduction of further cognitive decline and improved quality of life amongst older adults with mild AD. We anticipate that the results of this study will have implications for the development of cost-effective evidence-based best practice to treat people with mild AD.
