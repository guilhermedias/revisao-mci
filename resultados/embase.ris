N2  - Objective: To provide evidence about the efficacy of a community health intervention through a cognitive stimulation program at long term in older people with mild cognitive impairment. Design: Randomized controlled trial (CONSORT group norms). Location: San José Norte-Centro Primary Care Center and La Caridad Foundation (Zaragoza, Spain). Participants: Twenty-nine people over 65 years old with a 24-27 MEC score that completed 48 months follow up. They were randomized between the intervention group (15) and the control group (14). Interventions: The intervention was applied in 10 sessions of 45 min for 10 weeks using the red notebook tool for mental activation that works memory, orientation, language, praxis, gnosis, calculation, perception, logical reasoning, attention and executive functions. Main measurements: The main outcome variables were MEC-35, Set-test, Barthel index, Lawton-Brody scale, Goldberg anxiety scale and Yesavage geriatric depression scale short form. Results: Increases of the main result variable over the baseline level of MEC-35 were analyzed. On average, the intervention group obtained higher scores than control: 3.14 points post intervention, 3.76 points after 6 months and 2.26 points more than control group after 12 months. All the differences were statistically significant. After 48 months the intervention group obtained 2 points more than control group. The intervention did not improve verbal fluency, activity daily living and mood. Conclusions: Our cognitive stimulation program seems to improve cognitive performance, measured with the variable MEC-35 at post intervention, 6, 12 and 48 months. There is no evidence of improvement in verbal fluency, activity daily livings and mood. Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT03831061.

N2  - It has clearly been demonstrated that cognitive stimulation, physical exercise, and social engagement help counteract age-related cognitive decline. However, several important issues remain to be addressed. Given the wide differences in cognitive impairment found among individuals of the same age, identifying the subjects who will benefit most from late-life interventions is one such issue. Environmental Enrichment (EE) is a particularly valuable approach to do this. In this study, aged (21-month-old) rats were assigned to a better (BL) or a worse (WL) learner group (training phase) and to a non-impaired (NI) or an impaired (I) group (probe phase) by their performance on the Morris Water Maze, using the test performances of adult (12-month-old) rats as the cut-offs. The aged rats were retested after a 12-week EE or standard housing (SH) protocol. After 12 weeks, the performances of SH rats had deteriorated, whereas all rats benefited from EE, albeit in different ways. In particular, the animals assigned to the BL and the NI groups prior to EE still performed as well as the adult rats (performance preservation) whereas, critically, the animals assigned to the WL and the I groups before EE showed such improved performances that they reached the level of the adult rats (performance improvement), despite having aged further. EE seems to induce the preservation in BLs and the improvement in WLs of spatial search strategies and the preservation in NIs and the increase in Is of a focused and protract research of the escape point. Our findings suggest that late-life EE prevents spatial learning and memory decline in still cognitively preserved animals and stimulates residual functional reserve in already cognitively compromised animals. Future research should focus on individually tailored stimulation protocols to improve their effect and afford a better understanding of the underlying processes.

N2  - Background: Cognitive deficits, especially in attention, are common in persons with MS (PwMS) and are associated with clinically meaningful outcomes, such as work disability and lower quality of life (QOL). In this study, we aimed to determine whether Cogmed Working Memory Training (CWMT) improves attention/working memory in PwMS displaying impairment in these domains. Methods: This single blind, randomized controlled, pilot study compared the effects of CWMT, a five-week evidenced-based computer-assisted training program that is supported by weekly meetings with a coach, to standard medical care (treatment as usual). We recruited PwMS from one MS center (London (ON) Canada), aged 18-64, with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of ≤ 7.0, and a visual acuity (corrected) of at least 20/70. Potential subjects had to demonstrate impaired attention on at least two of three measures (Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test [PASAT], Symbol Digit Modalities Test [SDMT], and/or DKEFS Color-Word Interference Test); these measures also served as the primary study outcomes. Subjects were randomized to either the CWMT or treatment as usual. Secondary cognitive outcomes included other measures of attention, memory, as well as a self-reported cognitive function measure. Self-reported measures of mood (depression and anxiety), pain, and QOL were also included as other secondary outcomes. Subjects received assessments at baseline, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up, or an equivalent time period for the treatment as usual group. The two groups were compared at baseline on background measures using independent samples t-tests, Chi-Square tests, and Mann-Whitney U tests. To analyze primary and secondary outcomes, a non-parametric approach was used due the small sample size and that many of our outcomes did not meet assumptions for parametric analyses. Friedman's test was conducted followed by post hoc pairwise comparisons within each group using Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests with Bonferroni corrected post hoc contrasts, which allowed us to examine for differences between time points. Results: Of 30 subjects, 15 were assigned to CWMT. Significant training effects were noted in 1 of 3 primary attentional outcomes (DKEFS Color-Word Interference Test), 2 of 3 secondary attentional outcomes (Letter-Number Sequencing, Digit Span), and 1 mood scale (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) - Depression Subscale), ps <.025. No significant changes were observed in the treatment as usual group. Conclusion: This pilot study demonstrates that cognitive training with CWMT has the potential to improve attention/working memory in PwMS, as well as a potential positive effect on mood, in PwMS. Further exploration of this intervention in PwMS with attention/working memory impairment is warranted.

N2  - Background: It has been suggested that physical inactivity and lack of stimulating cognitive activity are the two most significant modifiable risk factors to impair cognitive function. Although many studies that investigated the cognitive effects of physical exercise and cognitive stimuli in dual-task conditions showed improved cognitive performance, others have not confirmed these findings. The main aim of the present work is to analyze the effects of a dual-task multimodal physical exercise training, at moderate intensity, and cognitive stimulation on cognitive and physical function in healthy older adults. Methods: This clinical trial was registered on the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (RBR-9zrx3d). Here we tested the effects of a dual-task multimodal physical exercise training, at moderate intensity, on cognitive and physical function and quality of life in community dwelling older adults. The training protocol included 24 group sessions, 2/week, per 75 min. Cognition was assessed using CANTAB automated neuropsychological tests and Functional Capacity to Exercise tests. Performance was compared from baseline to post intervention and to a non-exercise control group using Mixed Linear Model for repeated measures. Results: Control (CG) and dual-task (DTEx) groups progressed differentially over time on performance of episodic memory, sustained visual attention, functional mobility, cardiorespiratory fitness, lower limbs strength resistance, agility, quality of life and dual-task performance with significant improved DTEx performance. Control group did not show any significant changes on these tests except for showing a reduction in dual-task performance. Conclusion: We suggest that the dual-task combination of multisensory cognitive stimulation and multimodal moderate physical exercise training, twice a week, may be adopted as an effective program to reduce progression of age-related cognitive decline and improve physical fitness and quality of life on healthy older adults.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Living in a partnership has been shown to benefit later life health in general and decrease the risk of cognitive impairment. Few studies have, however, examined whether different types of partnership transitions also differ with respect to their impact on cognitive trajectories, and whether financial resources, health behaviors, cognitive stimulation and social integration can explain these differences. METHODS: Data came from six waves of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, which is a representative panel for the population aged 50 years or older, and was collected between 2004 and 2017 in 20 European countries. Our sample includes 215,989 valid person-year observations from 78,984 persons. Mean age at baseline is 64 years, and individuals were observed on average 2.7 times. Cognitive functioning was assessed with measures of immediate and delayed recall on a memory test, and verbal fluency. Fixed-effects regression models were employed to exploit individual-level variation in partnership and simultaneous cognitive changes. RESULTS: Partnership status was stable in most respondents (around 90%). Compared to remaining partnered and after controlling for socio-demographic factors, transition to divorce was associated with a steeper decline in immediate and delayed recall. Exploring possible mechanisms, both financial resources and social integration explained these differences. Additional analyses suggested that effects were mostly driven by individuals with lower education. DISCUSSION: Partnership transitions remain infrequent events in later life, but our findings indicate that they can induce less favorable cognitive trajectories compared to partnered individuals, particularly for those with lower cognitive reserve.

N2  - Background: The cognitive deterioration occurring in normal aging results in the alteration of brain white matter structure and neuronal connectivity. Thus, cognitive training is beneficial in enhancing the cognitive functions in elders with cognitive impairment. The diffusion tensor imaging method explores the nature of the white matter changes occurring during cognitive intervention. This study aimed to examine white matter integrity parameters in brain-related memory between elderly with cognitive impairment who received memory training and a non-trained group. Methods: Twenty participants were recruited for this study, and were assigned into experimental and control groups. The experimental group received a 36-session multimodal episodic memory training (MEMT) over a 12-week period. The magnetic resonance imaging scanned the corpus callosum, fornix, cingulum, and uncinate fasciculus, and then were analyzed using diffusion tensor imaging methods during, before, and after training. Results: After MEMT training, the white matter integrity indices all targeted brain area demonstrated no significant differences (p>0.05). However, the FA values of uncinated fasciculus areas showed the tendency to increase after training. Conclusion: This finding could indicate the resilient anatomical possibilities of white matter structural changes after training. Moreover, the DTI technique has possible benefits regarding predicting the individualized white matter alternation underlying cognitive changes in the elderly.

N2  - There is ample scientific and clinical evidence of the effects of gut microbiota on the brain but no definitive evidence that the brain can affect changes in gut microbiota under the bi-directional gut-brain axis concept. As there is no pharmacotherapeutic intervention for the early stages of cognitive decline, research has focused on cognitive stimulation in reversing or slowing the impairment. Elderly patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment underwent a randomized-control trial of mindful awareness practice. Neuropsychological assessments, inflammatory markers, and gut microbiota profiles were tested. Here, we report that their cognitive impairment was improved and associated with changes in gut bacterial profile. A cognition-score-dependent-abundance was observed in Ruminococcus vs Recognition Trials (RT), Digit Span Backward (DSB), Semantic Fluency Span (SFS) and Memory Domain (MD); Coprococcus vs DSB, Color Trails Test 2 (CTT2) and Block Design (BD); Parabacteroides vs DSB and SFS; Fusobacterium vs DSB and CTT2; Enterobacteriaceae vs BD and SFS; Ruminococcaceae vs DSB; Phascolarctobacterium vs MD. The study showed for the first-time, alteration in the cognitive capacity leading to the corresponding changes in microbiota profiles. This strongly suggests that signals from the different segments of brain could dictate directly or indirectly the abundances of specific gut microbes.

N2  - Availability of reliable prognostic biomarkers that are also able to monitor preventive/therapeutic interventions in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is crucial. Cerebral brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) alterations were evidenced in Alzheimer's disease, but the value of blood BDNF in MCI is unclear, especially because of the incomplete/incorrect management of the numerous confounding factors unrelated to the disease. This study, applying a multidisciplinary methodological approach, aimed at clarifying whether blood BDNF can really mirror the cognitive symptoms of MCI, thus supporting the evaluation of clinical protocols' effectiveness as well as the definition of the conversion rate to dementia. Healthy elderly subjects (HE) and MCI patients were assessed for sociodemographic, neuropsychological, pharmacological, and lifestyle data, and plasma BDNF was measured (baseline); then, in the MCI cohort, the biomarker was tested in a comprehensive cognitive stimulation intervention (CS) as well as in a 2-year follow-up period. Plasma BDNF, cleansed from all the interfering factors, (1) did not discriminate HE and MCI patients; (2) in MCI patients reflected mood, social engagement, and subjective memory complaints but not cognition; (3) changed due to CS, although with no correlations to cognitive performances; and (4) predicted no functional deterioration. Our data indicate that the possible biased use of plasma BDNF in MCI is critically risky.

N2  - Interventions for age-associated cognitive impairment are of increasing significance as populations age. Using N-back and memory strategy enhancement, the present study aimed to explore the feasibility of using, and outcomes of a working memory (WM) training program on visuospatial and verbal WM in older female adults. Older women from two comparable local health centers who scored 26 and higher on Mini-Mental State Examination were invited to participate. Women at one center (experimental group) received three sessions on memory enhancement techniques and a computerized training program with N-back. Women at the other center (control group) received three sessions on memory and aging and training on using various features of cellphones. All participants completed the Corsi Block Task and Digit Span Task at pre- and post-training. The experimental group showed significant improvements in their visuospatial and verbal WM compared to the control group. These findings support the brain’s plasticity in the elderly. WM training for improving cognitive performance in older adults has potential and should be further investigated.

N2  - Objective: To provide evidence of the effectiveness of a community health intervention, that includes a cognitive stimulation program, to prevent the deterioration of cognitive abilities in our population of elderly people with normal cognition that are living in the community. Design: Randomized clinical trial (CONSORT group norms) Location: San José Norte-Centro Health Center and La Caridad Foundation (Zaragoza, Spain). Participants: 201 people aged 65 or older, with a MEC score of at least 28 points, which were randomized between the Intervention group (101) and the Control group (100). Intervention: The intervention was applied in 10 sessions of 45 minutes, one per week. It used materials designed by one of the authors, which addressed the following areas: memory, orientation, language, praxis, gnosis, calculation, perception, logical reasoning, attention-concentration and programming. Main measurements: The main outcome variables were MEC, Set-Test, Barthel and Lawton-Brody. Results: Increases of the main result variables over their baseline level were analized. For MEC variable, the Intervention group obtained, on average, 1.58 points more than the Control group in the evaluation performed immediately after the intervention. After 6 months, the improvement was 1.51 points and after a year, it was of 2.04 points. All these differences were statistically significant. For Set-Test, Barthel and Lawton-Brody variables, no statistically significant differences were observed between Intervention group and Control group. Conclusions: Cognitive stimulation with our program is effective to maintain or improve cognitive performance, measured with the variable MEC, our population of elderly people with normal cognition that are living in the community. There is no evidence that this improvement is transferred to the activities of daily life measured with Barthel and Lawton-Brody variables.

N2  - Aim: An online questionnaire study was used to examine subjective memory evaluation of elderly persons, previous experience with computerized cognitive training, interest in memory training using electronic devices and the preferred training technique. Methods: An online questionnaire containing 40 questions divided into 6 areas of interest was created. Using this questionnaire, we surveyed the approach of the seniors to memory training through electronic devices. Results: The questionnaire was completed by 511 respondents (average age 67 ± 7 years, average education 16 ± 4 years, 72 % of women). Most of the respondents (64 %) stated occurence of some memory problems. More than half of the respondents (59 %) did not previously use electronic devices to train memory. However, 76 % of the participants are interested in cognitive training using electronic devices. A great deal of respondents (67 %) prefered to train memory on a computer in contrast to tablets and smartphones. This is in line with the finding that 61 % of respondents use the computer on a daily basis. The vast majority of respondents (90 %) would like to train from home. Conclusion: The results of the study show that elderly persons are interested in remote computerized memory training in their home environment. The limited offer of Czech remote computerized training programms suggests increased demand for development of such training programs ratgeted specifically on elderly population.

N2  - Background: Associative object-location memory (OLM) is known to decline even in normal aging, and this process is accelerated in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Given the lack of curative treatment for Alzheimer's disease, activating cognitive resources during its preclinical phase might prevent progression to dementia. Objective: To evaluate the effects of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS) combined with an associative episodic memory training on OLM in MCI patients and in healthy elderly (HE). Methods: In a single-blind cross-over design, 16 MCI patients and 32 HE underwent a 3-day visuospatial OLM training paired with either 20:min or 30:s (sham) atDCS (1:mA, right temporoparietal cortex). Effects on immediate (training success) and long-term memory (1-month) were investigated by conducting Mixed Model analyses. In addition, the impact of combined intervention on within-session (online) and on between-session (offline) performance were explored. Results: OLM training+atDCS enhanced training success only in MCI patients, but not HE (difference n.s.). Relative performance gain was similar in MCI patients compared to HE under atDCS. No beneficial effect was found after 1-month. Exploratory analyses suggested a positive impact on online, but a negative effect on offline performance in MCI patients. In both groups, exploratory post-hoc analyses indicated an association between initially low-performers and greater benefit from atDCS. Conclusion: Cognitive training in MCI may be enhanced by atDCS, but further delineation of the impact of current brain state, as well as temporal characteristics of multi-session atDCS-training application, may be needed to induce longer-lasting effects.

N2  - Observed influences of system response delay in spoken human-machine dialogues are rather ambiguous and mainly focus on perceived system quality. Studies that systematically inspect effects on cognitive performance are still lacking, and effects of individual characteristics are also often neglected. Building on benefits of cognitive training for decelerating cognitive decline, this Wizard-of-Oz study addresses both issues by testing 62 elderly participants in a dialogue-based memory training with a virtual agent. Participants acquired the method of loci with fading instructional guidance and applied it afterward to memorizing and recalling lists of German nouns. System response delays were randomly assigned, and training performance was included as potential mediator. Participants' age, gender, and subscales of affinity for technology (enthusiasm, competence, positive and negative perception of technology) were inspected as potential moderators. The results indicated positive effects on recall performance with higher training performance, female gender, and less negative perception of technology. Additionally, memory retention and facets of affinity for technology moderated increasing system response delays. Participants also provided higher ratings in perceived system quality with higher enthusiasm for technology but reported increasing frustration with a more positive perception of technology. Potential explanations and implications for the design of spoken dialogue systems are discussed.

N2  - As the demographic structure in western societies ages, the prevalence and impact of cognitive decline rises. Thus, new solutions to tackle this problem are required. The use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)-based cognitive exercises has emerged in the last few decades, though with inconsistent results. Hence, we conducted a pre-post treatment study to further investigate this approach. We designed a set of virtual reality exercises that mimic activities of daily living by which the patient can train different cognitive domains. Twenty-five participants, ages 65-85, underwent 12 training sessions between the pre-treatment and post-treatment assessments. Significant increases were seen between the two assessments for some of the neuropsychological measures: visual memory, attention, and cognitive flexibility. Results also suggest that participants with lower baseline cognitive performance levels improved most after these sessions.

N2  - Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a phase in cognitive decline when it is still possible to intervene to reverse the decline. Cognitive stimulation delivered through psychosocial interventions provides both psychological intervention and social stimulation to improve cognition. A pilot open-label parallel-arms randomized controlled trial was undertaken to examine the effects of art therapy (AT) and music reminiscence activity (MRA) compared to the control, on the primary outcome of neurocognitive domain assessments in elderly people with MCI. Methods: Community-living elderly people with MCI (Petersen's criteria), assessed for study eligibility, were randomized using a web-based system with equal allocation to two intervention arms: AT (guided viewing of art pieces and production of visual arts) and MRA (listening, and recalling memories related to music) and a control arm (standard care without any intervention). Interventions were led by trained therapists weekly for 3 months, then fortnightly for 6 months. Neurocognitive domains (mean of memory, attention, and visuo-spatial abilities standardized scores), psychological wellbeing (subsyndromal depression and anxiety) and telomere length as a biological marker of cellular ageing, were assessed by intervention-blinded assessors at baseline, 3 months and 9 months. Results: In total, 250 people were screened and 68 were randomized and included in the analysis. In the AT arm, neurocognitive domains improved compared to the control arm at 3 months (mean difference (d) = 0.40; 90% CI 0.126, 0.679) and were sustained at 9 months (d = 0.31; 90% CI 0.068, 0.548). There was some improvement in depression and anxiety at 3 and 9 months and in telomere length at 9 months, but this was not significant. Similar improvements were observed in the MRA arm over the control arm, but they were not significant. There were no intervention-related adverse effects. Conclusions: Art therapy delivered by trained staff as "art as therapy" and "art psychotherapy" may have been the significant contributor to cognitive improvements. The findings support cognitive stimulation for elderly people with cognitive decline and signal the need for larger studies and further investigation of carefully designed psycho-social interventions for this group.

N2  - The growing elderly population and the increased incidence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) call for the improvement of the quality and the efficacy of the healthcare and social support services. Exercise and cognitive stimulation have been demonstrated to mitigate cognitive impairment and oxidative stress (OxS) has been recognized as a factor that contributes to the advancement of neurodegenerative diseases. Taking these aspects into account, the impact of a novel virtual reality (VR)-based program combining aerobic exercise and cognitive training has been evaluated in the pilot study proposed here. Ten patients (aged 73.3 ± 5.7 years) with MCI (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE: 23.0 ± 3.4) were randomly assigned to either 6 weeks physical and cognitive training (EXP) or control (CTR) group. Evaluations of cognitive profile, by a neuropsychological tests battery, and OxS, by collection of blood and urine samples, were performed before and at the end of the experimental period. The assessment of the patients' opinions toward the intervention was investigated through questionnaires. EXP group showed a tendency towards improvements in the MMSE, in visual-constructive test and visuo-spatial tests of attention, while CTR worsened. EXP group showed a greater improvement than CTR in the executive test, memory functions and verbal fluency. No statistical significance was obtained when comparing within and between both the groups, probably due to small number of subjects examined, which amplifies the effect of the slight heterogeneity in scores recorded. Despite a greater worsening of Daily Living Activities tests, all participants reported a better performance in real life, thanks to the elicited self-perceived improvement. After training intervention OxS (i.e., reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, oxidative damage of lipids and DNA) decreased resulting in significantly (range p < 0.05-0.001) lower in EXP vs. CTR group. Although not conclusive, the recorded effects in the present study are promising and suggest that this proposal would be a useful tool in support of cognitive training reducing OxS too. However, further studies on larger scale samples of patients are needed.

N2  - Singapore has an ageing population with a projected 53,000 people aged = 60 years living with dementia by 2020. Primary care doctors have the opportunity to initiate early work-up for reversible causes of cognitive dysfunction, allowing identification of comorbidities and discussion of medical therapy options. Early diagnosis confers the sick role on the patient, which allays frustration and explains events and behaviour that may have strained relationships with family and friends. The patient can be encouraged to plan for future health and personal care options with a Lasting Power of Attorney and/or Advance Care Planning. Objective cognitive tests (e.g. abbreviated mental test and Mini- Mental State Examination) and brain imaging are adjuncts that help in formulating the diagnosis. Referral to a hospital memory clinic activates a multidisciplinary team approach to dementia, including clinical consultation, dementia counselling, physiotherapy sessions on gait/fall prevention, occupational therapy sessions on cognitive stimulation and caregiver training.

N2  - The cognitive impairment characterizing the phenotype of older adults has been related to the efficiency of the antioxidant system. This study aimed at investigating the effect of memory training (MT) on memory, global cognitive functioning, and the oxidant and antioxidant capacity of plasma. We recruited 52 healthy subjects aged over 60. Twenty-nine subjects were submitted to 6-months of MT (Experimental Group, EG), and 23 were used as a Control Group (CG). Global cognitive functioning was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Short- and Long-Term Memory (STM and LTM, respectively) by the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) at baseline (T0) and after 6-months (T1). Meanwhile, Reactive Oxygen Metabolites derivative compounds (d-ROMs), Biological Antioxidant Potential (BAP), and their ratio were evaluated on plasma. Results showed that the MMSE and RAVLT scores improved in EG at T1. At the same time, the d-ROMs levels significantly decreased, while the BAP and BAP/d-ROMs ratio showed an opposite trend. In both groups, the MMSE and LTM scores were negatively associated with d-ROMs levels, and positively correlated with BAP levels and the BAP/d-ROMs ratio. When we considered the Δvalue (Δvariable = variable post-MT minus variable pre-MT) in EG, the ΔMMSE and ΔLTM scores were negatively associated to Δd-ROMs, and positively to ΔBAP and ΔBAP/dROM. In conclusion, our results suggest that MT improves memory and global cognitive functioning. These processes were significantly associated to increase in resistance against oxidative stress at the plasma level in healthy older adults.

N2  - Introduction: Ubiquity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) coupled with relatively ineffectual pharmacologic treatments has spurred interest in nonpharmacologic lifestyle interventions for prevention or risk reduction. However, evidence of neuroplasticity notwithstanding, there are few scientifically rigorous, ecologically relevant brain training studies focused on building cognitive reserve in middle age to protect against cognitive decline. This pilot study will examine the ability of virtual reality (VR) cognitive training to improve cognition and cerebral blood flow (CBF) in middle-aged individuals at high AD risk due to parental history. Methods: The design is an assessor-blind, parallel group, randomized controlled trial of VR cognitive-motor training in middle-aged adults with AD family history. The experimental group will be trained with adaptive “real-world” VR tasks targeting sustained and selective attention, working memory, covert rule deduction, and planning, while walking on a treadmill. One active control group will perform the VR tasks without treadmill walking; another will walk on a treadmill while watching scientific documentaries (nonspecific cognitive stimulation). A passive (waitlist) control group will not receive training. Training sessions will be 45 minutes, twice/week for 12 weeks. Primary outcomes are global cognition and CBF (from arterial spin labeling [ASL]) at baseline, immediately after training (training gain), and 3 months post-training (maintenance gain). We aim to recruit 125 participants, including 20 passive controls and 35 in the other groups. Discussion: Current pharmacologic therapies are for symptomatic AD patients, whereas nonpharmacologic training is administrable before symptom onset. Emerging evidence suggests that cognitive training improves cognitive function. However, a more ecologically valid cognitive-motor VR setting that better mimics complex daily activities may augment transfer of trained skills. VR training has benefited clinical cohorts, but benefit in asymptomatic high-risk individuals is unknown. If effective, this trial may help define a prophylactic regimen for AD, adaptable for home-based application in high-risk individuals.

N2  - Background: Several modifiable lifestyle factors have been shown to have potential beneficial effects in slowing cognitive decline. Two such factors that may affect cognitive performance and slow the progression of memory loss into dementia in older adults are cognitive training and physical activity. There are currently no effective treatments for dementia; therefore, preventative strategies to delay or prevent the onset of dementia are of critical importance. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the relative effectiveness of simultaneous performance of memory training and aerobic exercise to a sequential performance intervention on memory functioning in older adults. Methods: 55 older adults (aged 60- 75) with subjective memory impairments (non-demented and non-MCI) completed the intervention that consisted of 90-minute small group classes held twice weekly. Participants were randomized to either 4-weeks of supervised strategy-based memory training done simultaneously while stationary cycling (SIM) or sequentially after the stationary cycling (SEQ). Standardized neurocognitive measures of memory, executive functioning, speed of processing, attention, and cognitive flexibility were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Results: The SIM group, but not the SEQ group, had a significant improvement on composite memory following the intervention (t(51) = 2.7, p = 0.01, effect size (ES) = 0.42) and transfer to non-trained reasoning abilities (t(51) = 6.0, ES = 0.49) and complex attention (t(51) = 3.1, p = 0.003, ES = 0.70). Conversely, the SEQ group, but not the SIM, showed significant improvement in executive functioning (t(51) = 5.0, p = 0.0001, ES = 0.96). Conclusion: These findings indicate that a 4-week simultaneous memory training and aerobic exercise program is sufficient to improve memory, attention, and reasoning abilities in older adults.

N2  - Aging cognitive decline has been associated to impairment of the Hypothalamus Pituitary Adrenals (HPA) axis activity and a higher level of the systemic inflammation. However, little is known about the molecules driving this process at peripheral level. In addition, the cognitive function is to some extent modifiable with Memory Training (MT) programs, even among older adults and beyond. The study aims to evaluate whether MT could contribute to ameliorate cognitive performance and modulate the HPA axis activity as well the low level inflammation in the aging phenotype. Whether the phosphatase WIP-1, a negative regulator for inflammation, is involved in this process was also investigated. We recruited 31 young adults (19-28, years of age) and 62 older adults aged over 60. Thirty-two older adults were submitted to 6-months of MT program (EG), and 28 older adults were no treated and used as Control Group (CG). Global cognitive functioning (MMSE score), verbal and visual memory, and attention were assessed at baseline (T0) and after 6-months (T1). At the same time, plasmatic level of Cortisol (C), IL-1β, IL-18, IL-6, and the expression of WIP-1 mRNA and protein in ex vivo Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells were analyzed in young adults at T0, as well in older adults at T0 and T1. Together, the results suggest that MT improves the global cognitive functionality, verbal and visual memory, as well as the level of attention. At the same time we observed a decrease of the plasmatic level of C, of the cytokines, and an increase of the expression of mRNA and protein of WIP-1. The analysis of correlations highlighted that the level of the mRNA of WIP-1 was positively associated to the MMSE score, and negatively to the C and cytokine levels. In conclusion, we purpose the MT as tool that could help support successful aging through the improving of memory, attention and global cognitive function performance. Furthermore, this approach could participate to maintain lower the peripheral levels of the C and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The WIP-1 as a potential new target of the pathophysiology of aging is theorized.

N2  - Background: The aging of posture and balance function alters the quality of life in older people and causes serious problems in terms of public health and socio-economic costs for our modern societies. Method: This article reviews the various causes of imbalance and dizziness in the elderly, and considers how to prevent falls, and how to rehabilitate a faller subject in order to regain a good quality of life. Two effective ways of intervention are discussed, emphasizing the crucial role of physical activity and cognitive stimulation, classic or using the latest technical advances in virtual reality and video games. Results: Fall in the elderly result from aging mechanisms acting on both the sensorimotor and cognitive spheres. The structural and functional integrity of the peripheral sensory receptors and the musculoskeletal system deteriorate with age. The brain ages and the executive functions, memory, learning, cortical processing of information, sharing of attentional resources and concentration, are modified in the elderly. Psychological affective factors such as depression, anxiety and stress contribute also to speed up the sensorimotor and cognitive decline. The rehabilitation of the postural balance in the elderly must take into account all of these components. Conclusion: The aging of the population and the increased of lifespan are a challenge for our modern societies regarding the major health and socio-economic questions they raise. The fall in the elderly being one of the dramatic consequences of the aging equilibration function, it is therefore imperative to develop rehabilitation procedures of balance.

N2  - Introduction We sought to identify whether intensive 10-week mobile health mnemonic strategy training (MST) could shift the resting-state brain network more toward cortical-level integration, which has recently been proven to reflect the reorganization of the brain networks compensating the cognitive decline. Methods One hundred fifty-eight patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were selected and participated in 10-week training lasting 90 min/d of memory training. They benefited from an initial and a follow-up neuropsychological evaluation and resting-state electroencephalography (EEG). Results At follow-up, MST revealed an extensive significant training effect that changed the network with an increase of synchronization between parietotemporal and frontal areas; frontalθ-parietalα2 causal strengthening as part of top-down inhibitory control; enhancement of sensorimotor connections in β band; and a general increase of cortical-level integration. More precisely, MST induced gain as an increase of the global cost efficiency (GCE) of the whole cortical network and a neuropsychological performance improvement, which was correlated with it (r = 0.32, P = .0001). The present study unfolded intervention changes based on EEG source activity via novel neuroinformatic tools for revealing intrinsic coupling modes in both amplitude-phase representations and in the mixed spectrospatiotemporal domain. Discussion Further work should identify whether the GCE enhancement of the functional cortical brain networks is a compensation mechanism to the brain network dysfunction or a more permanent neuroplasticity effect.

N2  - Subjective cognitive and memory complaints (SMC) are common in later life and are considered an indicator for progression to cognitive decline. The aim of the present study was to identify the relationship among SMC, neuropsychiatric symptoms and psychological aspects in elderly subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as well as to analyse the effect on SMC of a comprehensive cognitive training. Data from a sample of 94 patients enrolled in ‘My Mind Project’ (Grant No. 154/GR-2009-1584108) were collected. The study evidenced that depression was a significant predictor of SMC and that after the training, the number of subjects with SMC was significantly reduced in the experimental group in comparison to the control one. These results suggest that the participation in cognitive stimulation protocols may improve the perception of SMC in subjects with MCI.

N2  - Background: About one-third of people older than 65 years fall at least once a year. Physical exercise has been previously demonstrated to improve gait, enhance physical fitness, and prevent falls. Nonetheless, the addition of cognitive training components may potentially increase these effects, since cognitive impairment is related to gait irregularities and fall risk. We hypothesized that simultaneous cognitive–physical training would lead to greater improvements in dual-task (DT) gait compared to exclusive physical training. Methods: Elderly persons older than 70 years and without cognitive impairment were randomly assigned to the following groups: 1) virtual reality video game dancing (DANCE), 2) treadmill walking with simultaneous verbal memory training (MEMORY), or 3) treadmill walking (PHYS). Each program was complemented with strength and balance exercises. Two 1-hour training sessions per week over 6 months were applied. Gait variables, functional fitness (Short Physical Performance Battery, 6-minute walk), and fall frequencies were assessed at baseline, after 3 months and 6 months, and at 1-year follow-up. Multiple regression analyses with planned comparisons were carried out. Results: Eighty-nine participants were randomized to three groups initially; 71 completed the training and 47 were available at 1-year follow-up. DANCE/MEMORY showed a significant advantage compared to PHYS in DT costs of step time variability at fast walking (P=0.044). Training-specific gait adaptations were found on comparing DANCE and MEMORY: DANCE reduced step time at fast walking (P=0.007) and MEMORY reduced gait variability in DT and DT costs at preferred walking speed (both trend P=0.062). Global linear time effects showed improved gait (P<0.05), functional fitness (P<0.05), and reduced fall frequency (−77%, P<0.001). Only single-task fast walking, gait variability at preferred walking speed, and Short Physical Performance Battery were reduced at follow-up (all P<0.05 or trend). Conclusion: Long-term multicomponent cognitive–physical and exclusive physical training programs demonstrated similar potential to counteract age-related decline in physical functioning.

N2  - Background: There has been longstanding interesting in cognitive training for older adults with cognitive impairment. In this study, we will investigate the effects of working memory training, and explore augmentation strategies that could possibly consolidate the effects in older adults with mild neurocognitive disorder. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been demonstrated to affect the neuronal excitability and reported to enhance memory performance. As tDCS may also modulate cognitive function through changes in neuroplastic response, it would be adopted as an augmentation strategy for working memory training in the present study. Methods/Design: This is a 4-week intervention double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) of tDCS. Chinese older adults (aged 60 to 90 years) with mild neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease (DSM-5 criteria) would be randomized into a 4-week intervention of either tDCS-working memory (DCS-WM), tDCS-control cognitive training (DCS-CC), and sham tDCS-working memory (WM-CD) groups. The primary outcome would be working memory test - the n-back task performance and the Chinese version of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog). Secondary outcomes would be test performance of specific cognitive domains and mood. Intention-to-treat analysis would be carried out. Changes of efficacy indicators with time and intervention would be tested with mixed effect models. Discussion: This study adopts the theory of neuroplasticity to evaluate the potential cognitive benefits of non-invasive electrical brain stimulation, working memory training and dual stimulation in older adults at risk of cognitive decline. It would also examine the tolerability, program adherence and adverse effects of this novel intervention. Information would be helpful for further research of dementia prevention studies.

N2  - Background: Cognitive impairment is a health problem that concerns almost every second elderly person. Physical and cognitive training have differential positive effects on cognition, but have been rarely applied in combination. This study evaluates synergistic effects of multicomponent physical exercise complemented with novel simultaneous cognitive training on cognition in older adults. We hypothesized that simultaneous cognitive–physical components would add training specific cognitive benefits compared to exclusively physical training. Methods: Seniors, older than 70 years, without cognitive impairment, were randomly assigned to either: 1) virtual reality video game dancing (DANCE), 2) treadmill walking with simultaneous verbal memory training (MEMORY), or 3) treadmill walking (PHYS). Each program was complemented with strength and balance exercises. Two 1-hour training sessions per week over 6 months were applied. Cognitive performance was assessed at baseline, after 3 and 6 months, and at 1-year follow-up. Multiple regression analyses with planned comparisons were calculated. Results: Eighty-nine participants were randomized to the three groups initially, 71 completed the training, while 47 were available at 1-year follow-up. Advantages of the simultaneous cognitive–physical programs were found in two dimensions of executive function. “Shifting attention” showed a time×intervention interaction in favor of DANCE/MEMORY versus PHYS (F[2, 68] =1.95, trend P=0.075, r=0.17); and “working memory” showed a time×intervention interaction in favor of DANCE versus MEMORY (F[1, 136] =2.71, trend P=0.051, R2=0.006). Performance improvements in executive functions, long-term visual memory (episodic memory), and processing speed were maintained at follow-up in all groups. Conclusion: Particular executive functions benefit from simultaneous cognitive–physical training compared to exclusively physical multicomponent training. Cognitive–physical training programs may counteract widespread cognitive impairments in the elderly.

N2  - Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease associated with progressive memory and cognitive decline. Previous studies have identified the benefits of cognitive enrichment on reducing disease pathology. Additionally, epidemiological and clinical data suggest that repeated exercise, and cognitive and social enrichment, can improve and/or delay the cognitive deficiencies associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study, 3xTg-AD mice were exposed to a rigorous training routine beginning at 3 months of age, which consisted of repeated training in the Morris water maze spatial recognition task every 3 months, ending at 18 months of age. At the conclusion of the final Morris water maze training session, animals subsequently underwent testing in another hippocampus-dependent spatial task, the Barnes maze task, and on the more cortical-dependent novel object recognition memory task. Our data show that periodic cognitive enrichment throughout aging, via multiple learning episodes in the Morris water maze task, can improve the memory performance of aged 3xTg-AD mice in a separate spatial recognition task, and in a preference memory task, when compared to naïve aged matched 3xTg-AD mice. Furthermore, we observed that the cognitive enrichment properties of Morris water maze exposer, was detectable in repeatedly trained animals as early as 6 months of age. These findings suggest early repeated cognitive enrichment can mitigate the diverse cognitive deficits observed in Alzheimer's disease.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The Long Lasting Memories (LLM) program concerns a newly integrated platform which combines cognitive exercises with physical activity within the context of advanced technologies. The main objective of this study was to present the preliminary results that determine the possible effectiveness of the LLM program in the improvement of cognitive functions and symptoms of depression in healthy elderly and subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHOD: Fifty healthy and MCI subjects participated in the study. All of them received one hour's physical training and 35 minutes' cognitive training, 3 times a week, during the 12 weeks of the program. Before and after the intervention all participants were assessed using a battery of neuropsychological tests.
RESULTS: The results showed a significant improvement after the LLM training in global cognitive function, in verbal memory, in attention, in episodic memory and symptoms of depression.
CONCLUSION: This study indicates that LLM is a promising solution for older adults with and without cognitive impairment, maintaining their wellbeing with few professional and technical requirements.

N2  - Background: Dementia affects 35 million people worldwide and is currently incurable. Many cases may be preventable because regular participation in physical, mental and social leisure activities during middle age is associated with up to 47% dementia risk reduction. However, the majority of middle-aged adults are not active enough. MCI is therefore a clear target for activity interventions aimed at reducing dementia risk. An active lifestyle during middle age reduces dementia risk but it remains to be determined if increased activity reduces dementia risk when MCI is already evident. Before this can be investigated conclusively, complex multimodal activity programmes are required that (1) combine multiple health promoting activities, (2) engage people with MCI, and (3) result in sufficient adherence rates.Methods: We designed the ThinkingFit programme to engage people with MCI in a complex intervention comprised of three activity components: physical activity, group-based cognitive stimulation (GCST) and individual cognitive stimulation (ICST). Engagement and adherence was promoted by applying specific psychological techniques to enhance behavioural flexibility in an early pre-phase and during the course of the intervention. To pilot the intervention, participants served as their own controls during a 6- to 12-week run-in period, which was followed by 12 weeks of activity intervention.Results: Out of 212 MCI patients screened, 163 were eligible, 70 consented and 67 completed the intervention (mean age 74 years). Activity adherence rates were high: physical activity = 71%; GCST = 83%; ICST = 67%. Significant treatment effects (p < .05) were evident on physical health outcomes (decreased BMI and systolic blood pressure, [pre/post values of 26.3/25.9 kg/m2 and 145/136 mmHg respectively]), fitness (decreased resting and recovery heart rate [68/65 bpm and 75/69 bpm]), and cognition (improved working memory [5.3/6.3 items]).Conclusions: We found satisfactory recruitment, retention and engagement rates, coupled with significant treatment effects in elderly MCI patients. It appears feasible to conduct randomized controlled trials of the dementia prevention potential of complex multimodal activity programmes like ThinkingFit.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov registration nr: NCT01603862; date: 17/5/2012. © 2014 Dannhauser et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition characterized by memory problems that are more severe than the normal cognitive changes due to aging, but less severe than dementia. Reduced working memory (WM) is regarded as one of the core symptoms of an MCI condition. Recent studies have indicated that WM can be improved through computer-based training. The objective of this study is to evaluate if WM training is effective in improving cognitive function in elderly patients with MCI, and if cognitive training induces structural changes in the white and gray matter of the brain, as assessed by structural MRI.Methods/Designs: The proposed study is a blinded, randomized, controlled trail that will include 90 elderly patients diagnosed with MCI at a hospital-based memory clinic. The participants will be randomized to either a training program or a placebo version of the program. The intervention is computerized WM training performed for 45 minutes of 25 sessions over 5 weeks. The placebo version is identical in duration but is non-adaptive in the difficulty level of the tasks. Neuropsychological assessment and structural MRI will be performed before and 1 month after training, and at a 5-month folllow-up.Discussion: If computer-based training results in positive changes to memory functions in patients with MCI this may represent a new, cost-effective treatment for MCI. Secondly, evaluation of any training-induced structural changes to gray or white matter will improve the current understanding of the mechanisms behind effective cognitive interventions in patients with MCI.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01991405.

N2  - The aim of the present report was to evaluate the effectiveness and impact of multisensory and cognitive stimulation on improving cognition in elderly persons living in long-term-care institutions (institutionalized [I]) or in communities with their families (noninstitutionalized [NI]). We compared neuropsychological performance using language and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) test scores before and after 24 and 48 stimulation sessions. The two groups were matched by age and years of schooling. Small groups of ten or fewer volunteers underwent the stimulation program, twice a week, over 6 months (48 sessions in total). Sessions were based on language and memory exercises, as well as visual, olfactory, auditory, and ludic stimulation, including music, singing, and dance. Both groups were assessed at the beginning (before stimulation), in the middle (after 24 sessions), and at the end (after 48 sessions) of the stimulation program. Although the NI group showed higher performance in all tasks in all time windows compared with I subjects, both groups improved their performance after stimulation. In addition, the improvement was significantly higher in the I group than the NI group. Language tests seem to be more efficient than the MMSE to detect early changes in cognitive status. The results suggest the impoverished environment of long-term-care institutions may contribute to lower cognitive scores before stimulation and the higher improvement rate of this group after stimulation. In conclusion, language tests should be routinely adopted in the neuropsychological assessment of elderly subjects, and long-term-care institutions need to include regular sensorimotor, social, and cognitive stimulation as a public health policy for elderly persons. © 2014 De Oliveira et al.

N2  - Objective The Ubiquitous Spaced Retrieval-based Memory Advancement and Rehabilitation Training (USMART) program was developed by transforming the spaced retrieval-based memory training which consisted of 24 face-to-face sessions into a self-administered program with an iPAD app. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of USMART in elderly subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods Feasibility was evaluated by checking the satisfaction of the participants with a 5-point Likert scale. The efficacy of the program on cognitive functions was evaluated by the Korean version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Neuropsychological Assessment Battery before and after USMART. Results Among the 10 participants, 7 completed both pre- and post-USMART assessments. The overall satisfaction score was 8.0±1.0 out of 10. The mean Word List Memory Test (WLMT) scores significantly increased after USMART training after adjusting for age, educational levels, baseline Mini-Mental Status Examination scores, and the number of training sessions (pre-USMART, 16.0±4.1; post-USMART, 17.9±4.5; p=0.014, RM-ANOVA). The magnitude of the improvements in the WLMT scores significantly correlated with the number of training sessions during 4 weeks (r=0.793; p=0.033). Conclusion USMART was effective in improving memory and was well tolerated by most participants with MCI, suggesting that it may be a convenient and cost-effective alternative for the cognitive rehabilitation of elderly subjects with cognitive impairments. Further studies with large numbers of participants are necessary to examine the relationship between the number of training sessions and the improvements in memory function. © 2014 Korean Neuropsychiatric Association.

N2  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of memory complaints on quality of life (QOL) in elderly community dwellers with or without mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: Participants included 120 normal controls (NC) and 37 with MCI aged 65 and over. QOL was measured using the Japanese version of Satisfaction in Daily Life, and memory complaints were measured using a questionnaire consisting of four items. The relevance of QOL was evaluated with psychological factors of personality traits, sense of self-efficacy, depressive mood, self-evaluation of daily functioning, range of social activities (Life-Space Assessment), social network size, and cognitive functions including memory. The predictors of QOL were analyzed by multiple linear regression analysis. Results: QOL was not significantly different between the NC and MCI groups. In both groups, QOL was positively correlated with self-efficacy, daily functioning, social network size, Life-Space Assessment, and the personality traits of extraversion and agreeableness; QOL was negatively correlated with memory complaints, depressive mood, and the personality trait of neuroticism. In regression analysis, memory complaints were a negative predictor of QOL in the MCI group, but not in the NC group. The partial correlation coefficient between QOL and memory complaints was -0.623 (P < 0.05), after scores of depressive mood and self-efficacy were controlled. Depressive mood was a common negative predictor in both groups. Positive predictors were Life-Space Assessment in the NC group and sense of self-efficacy in the MCI group. Conclusions: Memory complaints exerted a negative impact on self-rated QOL in the MCI group, whereas a negative correlation was weak in the NC group. Memory training has been widely practised in individuals with MCI to prevent the development of dementia. However, such approaches inevitably identify their memory deficits and could aggravate their awareness of memory decline. Thus, it is critical to give sufficient consideration not to reduce QOL in the intervention for those with MCI.

Background
The recently revised Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V)1 utilizes the term “major neurocognitive disorder” to describe what has previously been known as dementia. However, given that this systematic review reflects previously published literature, the term “dementia” will be used.
In 2013, over 35 million people around the world were estimated to have dementia.2 The number of people worldwide with dementia is projected to increase to 65.7 million in 2030 and 115.4 million in 2050, which is approximately a doubling of sufferers every 20 years.2 Dementia is a syndrome of progressive cognitive and functional deterioration which is incurable.2 There are diverse symptoms and various levels of impairment depended on affected brain regions and types of dementia. Typical symptoms in the early phase of illness include memory loss, affected mood and behavior, and indications of depression.3,4 In the intermediate phase, increased communication difficulties, behavior changes such as wandering, agitation and aggression can appear. In the last phase of dementia illness, severe symptoms appear such as unawareness of time, place, inability to recognise familiar people, and severely limited mobility.3,4 The most common type of dementia is Alzheimer’s disease which accounts for 60-70% of the incidence of dementia. The remainder include vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia and so on. There is no known cure or treatment that alters the degenerative process of dementia.4 Having an irreversibly worsening projection, dementia gradually makes affected people increasingly reliant on others for help with daily living, often leading to placement in residential long term care (LTC).4,5
Although there are different types and labels of LTC services across the world,5,6 LTC services can be roughly categorized into both home-based services and residential facility-based services.5 Many OECD countries encourage home-based care which enables clients to have more flexibility, independence and self-determination.5 Nonetheless, as problematic behaviors occur and function declines, eventually, people with dementia are likely to require care in a residential LTC facility for ongoing care.7-9 The prevalence of dementia is relatively high in people living in LTC facilities. Estimates of the incidence of dementia widely vary from 40% to 80% in residential LTC facilities.3,10-12 Furthermore, residing in residential LTC tends to be related to a reduced quality of life (QOL) for residents,14,15 and people with dementia have an increased likelihood to face challenges in relation to their human rights and QOL compared to other people,4 as a consequence of decreased cognition, reduced language skills and introspection in people with dementia. Accordingly, improving and assuring QOL of LTC residents with dementia is imperative.
A number of studies concerning QOL have been undertaken with little consensus on the definition of QOL, because of its subjective qualities.6,16-19 The World Health Organization Quality of Life [WHOQOL] group involving 15 countries defined QOL as “an individual’s perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, and standards and concerns”.20(p.1405) Furthermore, the WHOQOL group illustrated that contributors of QOL can include multiple features such as physical, psychological, spiritual, social, and environmental aspects. Hence the meaning of QOL is broad, with multiple facets.
Many studies suggest that diverse indicators are correlated to QOL of people living in LTC facilities. Khader investigated several factors influencing QOL of the residents in three nursing homes in Jordan.21 The results indicated that the levels of QOL were determined by numerous factors such as age, level of education, and marital status. For instance, in relation to length of stay, residents who had lived for eleven years or more had a decreased level of QOL in most domains as compared with those who had lived for eleven years and less.21 Robichaud and colleagues also explored QOL indicators in nursing homes from the perspective of residents and their families and identified that feelings of respect, involvement in relationships, professional competency, privacy, staff stability and so on.15
Furthermore, the QOL of people with dementia is likely to be more complex compared to those without dementia. Cordner investigated measures of QOL in nursing home residents with advanced dementia.22 This study indicated that higher cognitive function of residents and the application of pain medication lead to a higher QOL, while those with behavior problems had a lower QOL. Another study systematically reviewed 13 studies to investigate factors related to QOL of people with dementia in long-term care facilities.23 This review identified that socio-demographic characteristics, depressive symptoms and anxiety, behavior, dependency in activities of daily living, cognition, severity of dementia and medication use all influence QOL. This review concluded that, particularly, depressive symptoms are reliable factors which are negatively correlated to QOL. From these findings, it may be implied that multifaceted approaches are needed when care services and interventions are applied in order to improve QOL of individuals with dementia living in long term care facilities.
As there is currently no known cure for dementia, many studies have been conducted focusing on interventions to improve QOL of people with dementia.24-27 Diverse interventions such as physical activity, psychological therapy, behavioral care or education of staff/care givers are potentially beneficial to people with dementia by improving cognitive and functional capabilities, to postpone deterioration, as well as to reduce behavioral symptoms. Ultimately, the aim of these interventions is to maintain or to improve QOL of individuals with dementia by reducing dementia-associated symptoms and incapacity.26,28-30
In recent years, there has been a gradual movement towards the evaluation of LTC services for residents with dementia through evidence of the outcomes of care.4,31-33 This shift seems to be come from the realisation that the significant objective of care provision is to promote QOL of residents, not simply to improve quality of care delivery.32 This suggests that quality of care should be monitored for improving residents’ QOL. Similarly, a World Alzheimer Report4 demonstrated that quality of care should be ascertained through QOL or satisfaction of residents in LTC facilities. Traditionally, there are diverse objective measures of resident outcome, such as level of independence,34 cognitive function,25,35 and reduced neuropsychiatric symptoms.36,37 These measures have generally been accepted through their long-lasting use; however, functional improvement does not necessarily mean an enhancement of QOL. For instance, a pilot study of 35 residents with dementia showed that participants receiving cognitive stimulation therapy had a significant improvement in cognitive function but no effect on QOL.38 Another randomized controlled trial including 42 participants with dementia also examined the effect of individual music therapy on agitation and other disruptive behaviors, QOL and medication.39 The results indicated that music therapy reduced agitation, disruptive behavior and prevented medication increases, but music therapy made no difference to QOL. Taking into consideration that enhancing QOL is the significant objective of dementia care,4 it is essential that QOL remains a primary outcome of interventions. In other words, evaluations of the effectiveness of interventions should contain QOL measurements for people with dementia. Accordingly, the application of QOL measurements to the outcome of healthcare interventions may help to define effective and efficient interventions in residential LTC settings.
In order to improve QOL, the efforts to find and integrate effective interventions in residential LTC settings should be ongoing. Although several reviews have contributed to identifying various interventions on QOL of residents in LTC facilities,6 or to evaluate the effect of diverse interventions on QOL of people with dementia,40,41 there is so far no overview of the effectiveness of the interventions on QOL of people with dementia in residential LTC facilities. For that reason, the aim of this systematic review is to identify interventions that improve the QOL of people with dementia in residential LTC and to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions. This will assist healthcare providers in making decisions regarding the implementation of feasible interventions and the development of programs in accordance with their capabilities, resources and resident preferences.
Review question/objective
The objective of this review is to answer the following question:
Which interventions have the best outcomes related to improved quality of life of people with dementia in residential long-term care?

N2  - Subjective memory impairment (SMI) is a common risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, with few established options for treatment. Here we investigate the effects of two months episodic memory training on regional brain atrophy in 19 memory clinic patients with SMI. We used a sensitive longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging protocol and compared the patients with 42 matched healthy volunteers randomly assigned to a group performing the same training, or a no-training control group. Following intervention, the SMI sample exhibited structural gray matter volume increases in brain regions encompassing the episodic memory network, with cortical volume expansion of comparable extent as healthy training participants. Further, we found significant hippocampal volume increases in the healthy training group but not in the SMI group. Still, individual differences in left hippocampal volume change in the patient group were related to verbal recall improvement following training. The present results reinforce earlier studies indicating intact brain plasticity in aging, and further suggest that training-related brain changes can be evident also in the earliest form of cognitive impairment.

N2  - Cognitive decline in aging is a pressing issue associated with significant healthcare costs and deterioration in quality of life. Previously, we reported the successful use of a novel brain-computer interface (BCI) training system in improving symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Here, we examine the feasibility of the BCI system with a new game that incorporates memory training in improving memory and attention in a pilot sample of healthy elderly. This study investigates the safety, usability and acceptability of our BCI system to elderly, and obtains an efficacy estimate to warrant a phase III trial. Thirty-one healthy elderly were randomized into intervention (n = 15) and waitlist control arms (n = 16). Intervention consisted of an 8-week training comprising 24 half-hour sessions. A usability and acceptability questionnaire was administered at the end of training. Safety was investigated by querying users about adverse events after every session. Efficacy of the system was measured by the change of total score from the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) before and after training. Feedback on the usability and acceptability questionnaire was positive. No adverse events were reported for all participants across all sessions. Though the median difference in the RBANS change scores between arms was not statistically significant, an effect size of 0.6SD was obtained, which reflects potential clinical utility according to Simon's randomized phase II trial design. Pooled data from both arms also showed that the median change in total scores pre and post-training was statistically significant (Mdn = 4.0; p<0.001). Specifically, there were significant improvements in immediate memory (p = 0.038), visuospatial/constructional (p = 0.014), attention (p = 0.039), and delayed memory (p<0.001) scores. Our BCI-based system shows promise in improving memory and attention in healthy elderly, and appears to be safe, user-friendly and acceptable to senior users. Given the efficacy signal, a phase III trial is warranted. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01661894 © 2013 Lee et al.

N2  - Working memory is a cognitive process that is particularly vulnerable to decline with age. The current study sought to evaluate the efficacy of a working memory training scheme in improving memory in a group of older adults. A 5-week online training scheme was designed to provide training in the main components of Baddeley's (2000) working memory model, namely auditory and visuospatial short-term and working memory. A group of older adults aged between 64 and 79 were randomly assigned to a trainee (n = 19) or control (n = 17) group, with trainees engaging in the adaptive training scheme and controls engaging in a non-adaptive version of the program. Before and after training and at 3- and 6-month follow-up sessions, trainees and controls were asked to complete measures of short-term and working memory, long-term episodic memory, subjective ratings of memory, and attention and achievement of goals set at the beginning of training. The results provided evidence of an expansion of auditory short-term memory span, which was maintained 6 months later, and transfer to long-term episodic memory but no evidence of improvement in working memory capacity per se. A serendipitous and intriguing finding of a relationship between time spent training, psychological stress, and training gains provided further insight into individual differences in training gains in older adults. © 2013 McAvinue, Golemme, Castorina, Tatti, Pigni, Salomone, Brennan and Robertson.

N2  - Objectives: Pictures are a popular tool for cognitive testing, memory training and speech therapy. However, a picture that can be termed in different ways can result in controversial interpretations. The correct naming of a picture depends on linguistic characteristics of the language (e.g. frequency and length of words), the drawing itself (how well it depicts the object), age, diagnosis and other factors. Therefore, we decided to form a file of pictures, obtain drawings and then select those with high level of name agreement (> 90%) in healthy seniors. Patients with Alzheimer's disease may vary in their ability to term a picture. Therefore, another aim of this research was to rank the pictures according to the grade of difficulty associated with their naming by patients with Alzheimer's disease. Subjects and methods: Different cohorts of healthy elderly repeatedly named two-dimensional line drawings from 10 categories: animals, tools, clothes, fruits, vegetables, body parts, plants, means of transport, food, musical instruments. The pictures were redrawn, added or eliminated in eight consecutive steps. The final quality screening of 70 pictures from the seventh set was carried out in 76 healthy seniors (age 78 ± 7 years) and 57 patients with Alzheimer's disease (age 81 ± 5 years, MMSE 22 ± 5 points). Results: The final set comprises 66 pictures in various semantic categories and with name agreement more than 90%. The graded naming difficulty was assessed by the difference in naming agreement between healthy elderly and patients with Alzheimer's disease. The pictures were divided into three groups: difficult (n = 13), moderate (n = 14) and easy (n = 40). Drawings showing hippopotamus, pretzel and walrus were the most difficult to name for AD patients. Conclusion: The full final set contains pictures with different degrees of difficulty. Each has its own semantic category and is named by one Czech word with high level of name agreement. They are suitable for multiple purposes.

N2  - Background: Improving the situation in older adults with cognitive decline and evidence of cognitive rehabilitation is considered crucial in long-term care of the elderly. The objective of this study was to implement a computerized errorless learning-based memory training program (CELP) for persons with early Alzheimer's disease, and to compare the training outcomes of a CELP group with those of a therapist-led errorless learning program (TELP) group and a waiting-list control group. Methods: A randomized controlled trial with a single-blind research design was used in the study. Chinese patients with early Alzheimer's disease screened by the Clinical Dementia Rating (score of 1) were recruited. The subjects were randomly assigned to CELP (n = 6), TELP (n = 6), and waiting-list control (n = 7) groups. Evaluation of subjects before and after testing, and at three-month follow-up was achieved using primary outcomes on the Chinese Mini-Mental State Examination, Chinese Dementia Rating Scale, Hong Kong List Learning Test, and the Brief Assessment of Prospective Memory-Short Form. Secondary outcomes were the Modified Barthel Index, Hong Kong Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, and Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form. The data were analyzed using Friedman's test for time effect and the Kruskal-Wallis test for treatment effect. Results: Positive treatment effects on cognition were found in two errorless learning-based memory groups (ie, computer-assisted and therapist-led). Remarkable changes were shown in cognitive function for subjects receiving CELP and emotional/daily functions in those receiving TELP. Conclusion: Positive changes in the cognitive function of Chinese patients with early Alzheimer's disease were initially found after errorless training through CELP. Further enhancement of the training program is recommended. © 2013 Lee et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

N2  - The aim of this study was to assess the self-perception of memory in elderly illiterate with mild cognitive impairment, before and after workshops of cognitive stimulation adapted for illiterate individuals. The research was qualitative, held at the Health Unit of Taguatinga-DF, involving 63 elderly illiterate: 22 in the experimental group (EG), with 10 workshops; 21 in control group 1 (CG1), with 10 lectures; and 20 in the control group 2 (GC2), without intervention. Semi-structured interviews were carried on before and after the interventions, asking about memory status. The activities offered weekly to EG and CG1 have had two hours of duration. The mean age of the participants was 72.8 years, and 92% were female. In pre-intervention, 82% reported worsening memory during the last year. In post-intervention, CG1 and CG2 kept memory changes, while EG improved cognition. One concludes that the provided workshops and lectures improved functionality and socialization / integration.

N2  - Background. In humans, retrospective studies suggest that habitual physical activity (PA) or cognitive activity (CA) can help maintain or improve cognitive function. Similar findings have been reported using physical exercise in animal studies; however, the exercise paradigms differ markedly in duration and frequency, making extrapolation difficult. Here, the authors present a novel PA and CA paradigm that combines voluntary wheel running with Hebb-Williams and radial arm maze (RAM) training. Methods. A total of 57 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 treatment groups: the PA, CA, and combined PA and CA groups and sedentary controls. PA (voluntary wheel running) and CA (Hebb-Williams mazes) consisted of a moderate 2 h/d, 5 d/wk treatment paradigm. Results. Animals exposed to a combination of PA and CA made significantly fewer working memory errors and exhibited superior choice accuracy when compared with animals exposed to either PA or CA alone in the 8-arm baited configuration of the RAM. Additional analyses revealed that the cognitive improvements were independent of exercise intensity/duration. Assessment of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels revealed a significant increase in hippocampal BDNF only in the PA-alone group. Conclusion. A novel combination of PA and CA improves learning and memory abilities independent of activity intensity, BDNF, or phosphorylated cyclic AMP response element binding protein levels. This is the first report of significant changes in cognitive ability using a paradigm involving moderate levels of PA plus cognitive stimulation. An adaptation of this paradigm may be particularly beneficial in slowing the development of mild cognitive impairment and subsequent dementia in elderly people. © The Author(s) 2012.

N2  - Objectives: The effectiveness of a cognitive training programme in enhancing the functional abilities of elderly persons with mild cognitive impairments was tested in an integrated home and institutional training programme focused on performing daily tasks. Methods: Twenty elderly participants were taught cognitive stimulation and memory encoding strategies for 10 weeks by an occupational therapist, or by nonprofessionals and community caregivers. The programme consisted of attention and memory stimulation, association-based and imagery-based strategies. Functional assessment (Chinese version of the disability assessment for dementia instrument and the instrumental activities of daily living scale) and neuropsychological tests (digit span forward test, word list memory subtest of the neuropsychological test battery developed by the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease, Cognistat) were administered before and after the programme. Results: After the 10-week programme the participants showed significant improvements in average attention and memory. The participants showed improved memory (word list memory: p ≤ .001) and other cognitive function as measured by the naming (p ≤ .001), construction (p ≤ .001), memory (p ≤ .001) and similarities (p ≤ .001) subtests of the Cognistat. Conclusion: These results provide initial evidence supporting the use of daily tasks as the context in teaching cognitive stimulation and memory encoding strategies to mildly impaired elderly people.

N2  - Objective According to the increase of older people, the need for effective methods to maintain or improve cognitive functions in the elderly has increased. These cognitive enhancing methods may contribute to the prevention of elderly cognitive decline by aging and dementing illness as well. This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of multistrategic memory training with the metamemory concept on cognitive functions in the normal health elderly in Korea. Methods The program used in this study was developed by psychiatrists and psychologists in accordance with Korean situations. We applied the training program to the community-dwelling elderly with subjective memory complaints. Twenty participants were randomly received the intervention with 20 non-treatment controls. This program consisted of 10 sessions and was administered once a week. We examined the effects of this memory training for verbal memory, visuospatial memory, working memory, and verbal fluency ability by repeated ANOVA. Results There were significant improvements in Word List Short-term Delayed Free and Cued Recall, Word list Long-term Delayed Free and Cued Recall and visuospatial recognition memory. Performance improvements in visuospatial span forwards and the Categorical Fluency Test were also significant. These improvements were still significant after adjusting for depression improvement exact categorical fluency. Conclusion This study shows that multistrategic memory training with the metamemory concept may improve memory ability and other cognitive functions which are not trained and that these improvements may be achieved by pure cognitive training effects. © 2011 Korean Neuropsychiatric Association.

N2  - The affirmative position is argued in response to the question of whether intervention in the disease course of Alzheimer disease (AD) occurs too late. AD is not a singular, homogeneous disease, but rather a final common pathway or end-point that can be arrived at through multiple routes. As part of the affirmative argument, there is a delineation of two long-term trajectories leading to AD: (1) normal elderly progression to AD, and (2) depressed elderly progression to AD. In documenting normal elderly devolution into AD, two "normal" elderly pre-AD or prodromal stages are discussed: age-associated memory impairment (AAMI) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Data are provided evidencing significantly high conversion rates from these pre-AD stages to actual AD. Using the same paradigmatic approach that is used in documenting normal elderly decline into AAMI and MCI with eventual conversion to AD; there is explication of depressed elderly conversion to AD. The long-term, multiphasic disease progression of major depression without dementia to depressive dementia to final conversion to AD is brought into focus as another example of why intervention must occur prior to actual conversion to AD. Depression is defined as a cognitive syndrome and risk factor for AD requiring aggressive targeted intervention. AD does not just come suddenly out of nowhere. First intervention must occur during the pre-AD phases in an attempt to prevent, delay, and interrupt long-term neurodegenerative processes involved in both normal elderly and depressed elderly conversion to AD. A primary strategy proposed is to delay onset of AD. Population statistics indicate that if AD is delayed by a modest 1 year, there would be 9.5 million fewer cases by 2050, resulting in significant reduction in burden of disease. Data show early intervention with cognitive stimulation (mental exercise), physical exercise, aggressive treatment of AD risk factors and excess disability, psychotherapy, and other nonpharmacological interventions in combination with each other and/or with medications can result in delay of onset of AD. First intervention at time of diagnosis of AD is too late, when by definition, final conversion to AD has already occurred. When we have knowledge to successfully intervene earlier, why would we not want to do so. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Objectives: The present study investigates the impact of unawareness of deficit (anosognosia) in patients with Alzheimer's disease upon professional health care burden. Design: Cross-sectional study with a consecutive clinical sample from an Alzheimer day-care hospital in France. Subjects: 65 patients with probable AD, aged from 75 to 94 years old, consecutively admitted at the Alzheimer Day Hospital to complete a program of cognitive stimulation and psychosocial rehabilitation. Measurements: Bach patient was submitted to a standardized evaluation including clinical investigation, cerebral imagery, and neuropsychological assessment. Anosognosia of memory deficit and anosognosia of behavioral disturbances were measured as the "discrepancy-scores" between patients' self-reports and family member ratings of patient memory performance and behavioral disturbances. Professional health care burden was assessed with the Professional Health Care Dementia Burden Index (PCDBI; maximal score: 12), designed for this study. Multiple linear regressions were used to examine the correlations between the PCDBI and the severity of anosognosia. Results: The findings showed a significant positive correlation between the PCDBI and both anosognosia of memory impairment and behavioral abnormalities (both p at least less than 0.05). However, there was no significant correlation between the severity of the burden and the severity of cognitive decline or functional impairment (both p at least>0.05). Conclusion: Anosognosia in Alzheimer disease patients has a negative impact upon the professional caregivers' burden over and above the cognitive deficit and the functional impairments. © 2011 Serdi and Springer Verlag France.

N2  - Objective: To investigate maintenance of training effects of a novel brain plasticity-based computerized cognitive training program in older adults after a 3-month no-contact period. Design: Multisite, randomized, controlled, double-blind trial with two treatment groups. Setting: Communities in northern and southern California and Minnesota. Participants: Four hundred eighty-seven community-dwelling adults aged 65 and older without diagnosis of clinically significant cognitive impairment. Intervention: Random assignment into a broadly available brain plasticity-based computerized cognitive training program experimental group or a novelty- and intensity-matched cognitive stimulation active control. Assessments at baseline, after training, and at 3 months. Measurements: The primary outcome was a composite of auditory subtests of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. Secondary measures included trained task performance, standardized neuropsychological assessments of overall memory and attention, and participant-reported outcomes (PROs). Results: A significant difference in improvement from baseline to 3-month follow-up was seen between the experimental training and control groups on the secondary composite of overall memory and attention, (P=.01, d=0.25), the trained processing-speed measure (P<.001, d=0.80), word list total recall (P=.004, d=0.28), letter-number sequencing (P=.003, d=0.29), and the cognitive subscale of PRO (P=.006, d=0.27). Previously significant improvements became nonsignificant at the 3-month follow-up for the primary outcome, two secondary measures of attention and memory, and several PROs. Narrative memory continued to show no advantage for the experimental group. Effect sizes from baseline to follow-up were generally smaller than effect sizes from baseline to posttraining. Conclusion: Training effects were maintained but waned over the 3-month no-contact period. © 2011 The American Geriatrics Society.
